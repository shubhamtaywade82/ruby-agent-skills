# Stack Minimality Debt

## Purpose
Track intentional simplifications that trade future flexibility or scale for present simplicity. The ledger prevents known ceilings from disappearing into tribal knowledge.

## Activate when
Use after minimality-driven implementation work or when asked to list deliberate shortcuts, deferred architecture, or known ceilings.

## Repository inspection
Search Ruby/Rails comments, TypeScript/React comments, SQL comments, ADRs, and documentation for stack-minimality markers. Exclude generated and vendored output.

## Decision rules
A valid marker states:
- what was simplified;
- the known ceiling;
- the event, measurement, or condition that should trigger reconsideration.

Examples:
- # stack-minimality: per-process cache; revisit when memory pressure or hit-rate evidence justifies shared caching
- // stack-minimality: feature-local state; revisit when another independent feature needs the same owner
- -- stack-minimality: sequential backfill; revisit when the deployment window no longer fits

## Implementation procedure
1. Scan all supported source/comment forms.
2. Record each marker with file and line.
3. Report its ceiling and trigger.
4. Flag markers with no concrete trigger as no-trigger.
5. Report counts.
6. Do not modify source files.

## Anti-patterns / failure modes
- Using markers to excuse missing security or data-integrity controls.
- Writing "revisit later" without a trigger.
- Keeping markers after the underlying shortcut has been removed.
- Marking every ordinary design decision as debt.

## Agent review checklist
- [ ] Ruby, Rails, TypeScript, React, and SQL markers searched.
- [ ] Generated/vendor output excluded.
- [ ] Ceiling and trigger captured.
- [ ] No-trigger entries highlighted.
- [ ] No source modifications made.

## Verification
Compare the ledger with repository search results. A marker without a trigger is incomplete debt documentation.
