# Rails Validations Engineering

## Purpose

Make validation behavior explicit, deterministic, and owned by the correct boundary.

This skill governs Rails Active Record and Active Model validation semantics. It covers validation lifecycle and bypass paths, built-in validator selection, validation contexts and conditions, associated validation, uniqueness versus database enforcement, custom validators, strict failures, structured ActiveModel::Errors contracts, validation callbacks, API/form error representation, security boundaries, performance, and deterministic tests.

Compose with rails-active-record for model/persistence semantics; rails-associations for relationship/autosave ownership; rails-active-model for non-persisted model-like objects; rails-database-engineering for constraints/indexes/transactions/locking; rails-action-controller for request input; rails-action-view and rails-i18n for form/translation behavior; rails-api-integration for API error contracts; rails-security for trust and authorization; rails-performance for validation-query cost; and rails-test-engineering/rails-test-engineering for verification.

Core boundary:

untrusted input
  -> casting/normalization
  -> semantic validation
  -> persistence/command
  -> database integrity

Validation is not authorization, not a transaction, and not a database constraint.

## Activate when

- adding or changing validates rules
- changing validate or validates_with
- introducing validation contexts
- adding conditional if/unless validation
- changing allow_nil, allow_blank, on, except_on, or strict
- changing validation error keys, types, details, messages, or JSON
- debugging valid?, invalid?, save, save!, create, or update behavior
- adding uniqueness or cross-record invariants
- validating associated records
- introducing a custom validator
- refactoring validation callbacks
- reviewing bulk/direct write paths
- changing form/API error rendering

Do not activate merely because a controller receives input. Use the owning request/input skill when no model validation contract changes.

## Repository inspection

Inspect before editing:

1. resolved Ruby/Rails versions and database adapter;
2. the model or Active Model object;
3. schema, migrations, nullability, indexes, foreign keys, and check/unique constraints;
4. association declarations and inverse/autosave behavior;
5. existing validations, custom validators, and validation callbacks;
6. callers using valid?, save, bang writes, or explicit validation contexts;
7. direct/bulk write paths such as insert_all, upsert_all, update_all, update_column, touch, or save(validate: false) where relevant;
8. controller/form/API error serialization;
9. translation keys and locale conventions;
10. existing model/request/system tests;
11. job/event/service entry points that mutate the same invariant;
12. performance evidence for validation queries or associated validation graphs.

Search for existing repository validation helpers before adding another abstraction.

## Boundary selection

### Model/application validation

Use validation when the rule describes whether an object is acceptable at that model/object boundary.

Examples include required fields, allowed value sets, comparable bounds, cross-attribute rules, state-dependent field requirements, and application-level uniqueness feedback.

### Database integrity

Use a database constraint when the invariant must survive concurrent writers, multiple application processes, direct database writers, or validation-bypassing operations.

A uniqueness validator improves feedback but does not create database uniqueness enforcement. Pair it with the required unique index/constraint when the invariant is authoritative.

### Authorization

Authorization answers whether an actor may perform an action against a resource. Never encode permission as ordinary validation.

### Workflow/orchestration

Do not use validation to send external requests, publish events, enqueue durable business work, mutate unrelated aggregates, coordinate multi-step workflows, or implement authorization policy.

## Decision rules

1. Select the boundary above, then load the matching reference below before changing behavior: lifecycle, validators, and conditions; contexts and errors; custom, associated, strict, and callback validation; uniqueness and bypass paths; or integration, performance, and security.
2. Put integrity that must hold under concurrency in the database; validation provides feedback, not a guarantee.

## Critical invariants

- Do not use custom contexts to make ordinary save silently accept invalid domain states.
- Treat direct and bulk writers as a validation bypass audit surface and make intentional bypasses explicit.

## References

Load only the reference for the boundary being changed, before changing behavior there. Each reference is self-contained and one level deep; none links to another. Consult a listed pattern from the pattern catalog only when the change needs its implementation shape.

| Load when | Reference | Covers | Patterns |
|---|---|---|---|
| a change adds or alters validators, when validation runs, or optional/conditional rules | [references/lifecycle-and-validators.md](references/lifecycle-and-validators.md) | Validation lifecycle; Built-in validator selection; Optionality and conditional validation | `validation-boundary`, `validation-condition-contract` |
| a change adds validation contexts or alters error keys, messages, or error details | [references/contexts-and-errors.md](references/contexts-and-errors.md) | Validation contexts; Validation errors | `validation-context-contract`, `validation-error-contract` |
| a change adds custom validation methods or validators, validates associations, uses strict validation, or adds validation callbacks | [references/custom-associated-strict.md](references/custom-associated-strict.md) | Custom validation methods; Associated validation; Strict validations; Validation callbacks | `validation-custom-validator`, `validation-associated-graph`, `validation-strict-failure`, `validation-callback-boundary` |
| a change validates uniqueness or concurrent invariants, or writes through paths that skip validation | [references/uniqueness-and-bypass.md](references/uniqueness-and-bypass.md) | Uniqueness and concurrent invariants; Validation bypass paths | `validation-uniqueness-database-contract`, `validation-bypass-audit` |
| validation errors cross an API/form/controller boundary, or a validation has performance or tenant-isolation impact | [references/integration-performance-security.md](references/integration-performance-security.md) | API, form, and controller integration; Performance; Security and tenant isolation | none |

## Implementation procedure

1. Resolve Rails/Ruby/adapter versions.
2. Identify the invariant and the boundary that owns it.
3. Inspect model, schema, indexes/constraints, associations, callbacks, write paths, callers, and tests.
4. Classify the rule as validation, database integrity, authorization, or workflow.
5. Select the narrowest built-in validator or justified custom validator.
6. Define optionality, context, conditions, and error identity.
7. Add/update database enforcement for concurrent authoritative invariants.
8. Audit validation-bypassing write paths.
9. Integrate errors with the actual form/API consumer.
10. Add focused boundary and conflict/failure tests.
11. Run repository validators and relevant Rails tests.
12. Inspect the final diff for duplicate rules, hidden side effects, and accidental error-contract changes.

## Failure modes

Watch for:

- using valid? as proof that persistence will always satisfy an invariant;
- using model validation as authorization;
- using validation contexts to silently weaken normal saves;
- relying on uniqueness validation without database enforcement;
- confusing nil, blank, false, and empty collection semantics;
- conditions that encode workflow or authorization;
- reusable validators that are actually one-off predicates;
- custom validators that perform I/O;
- strict validation where callers expect ordinary errors;
- human error strings treated as stable machine APIs;
- validation of huge association graphs;
- duplicate rules across controller, model, service, and database with different semantics;
- bulk write paths that bypass the only protection;
- validation callbacks with external side effects.

## Reference example

A reusable each-validator with an I18n-ready error key, plus an invariant the database constraint ultimately enforces.

```ruby
class CurrencyValidator < ActiveModel::EachValidator
  SUPPORTED = %w[usd eur gbp].freeze

  def validate_each(record, attribute, value)
    return if value.nil? # presence is a separate, explicit validation

    record.errors.add(attribute, :unsupported_currency, value: value) unless SUPPORTED.include?(value)
  end
end

class Invoice < ApplicationRecord
  validates :currency, currency: true, presence: true

  validate :due_on_is_future

  private

  def due_on_is_future
    return if due_on.blank? || due_on > Date.current

    errors.add(:due_on, "must be in the future")
  end
end

# The database check constraint remains the last line of defense under
# concurrent writers; model validation is feedback, not the guarantee.
```

## Agent review checklist

- [ ] rule owner is explicit
- [ ] runtime/version is resolved
- [ ] all relevant write paths are inspected
- [ ] nil/blank/false/boundary semantics are intentional
- [ ] context and condition semantics are explicit
- [ ] custom validator is justified
- [ ] strict failure behavior is intentional
- [ ] error keys/types/details/messages preserve the consumer contract
- [ ] authoritative uniqueness has database enforcement when required
- [ ] associated validation scope is bounded
- [ ] validation callbacks have no hidden workflow or external side effects
- [ ] authorization is not delegated to validation
- [ ] bypass paths are intentional
- [ ] deterministic tests cover the changed contract
- [ ] no unmeasured performance claim is introduced

## Verification

Verify at the owning boundary:

- valid and invalid state;
- nil/blank/false edge cases;
- create/update differences;
- custom contexts;
- conditional branches;
- strict failures when applicable;
- error type/details and rendered or wire representation;
- database conflict behavior for authoritative invariants;
- associated validation failure;
- bypass write behavior;
- deterministic repeated execution.

Run bin/validate and focused validation/system tests. For persistence invariants, include database-level verification through rails-database-engineering.

## Source foundation

This skill synthesizes the repository's existing validation guidance with The Ruby Workshop and Clean Ruby, and is grounded in the current Rails Active Record Validations and Active Model validation/error documentation. The current Rails guide documents validator semantics, lifecycle triggers and bypasses, conditional and strict validation, custom validators, and validation errors.

## Rails Validations changes

For deep Rails validation changes:
- inspect resolved Rails/Ruby/adapter versions, model/object definition, schema constraints, indexes, associations, callbacks, validation contexts, custom validators, error consumers, direct/bulk write paths, and tests;
- classify the boundary as lifecycle, validator semantics, condition/context, error contract, association validation, uniqueness/invariant enforcement, custom validator, strict failure, validation callback, or bypass path;
- keep ownership explicit: model validation answers whether state is acceptable at that boundary; database constraints own invariants that must survive concurrency and alternate writers;
- never use validation as authorization, tenant access control, transaction orchestration, external API success handling, or durable workflow;
- inspect all relevant write APIs because direct/bulk operations can bypass validations; use rails-database-engineering for authoritative constraints;
- treat on, except_on, if, unless, allow_nil, allow_blank, and strict as explicit contract choices and test their interactions;
- use custom validation contexts only for named operations with explicit callers; do not make ordinary save silently accept invalid domain state;
- prefer the narrowest built-in validator and justify reusable validator classes;
- keep validation callbacks local and deterministic; never hide external effects, authorization, or multi-step workflow in them;
- treat ActiveModel::Errors as a structured contract and preserve attribute/type/detail identity;
- keep associated validation graphs bounded and coordinate with inverse/autosave/nested-persistence ownership;
- pair application uniqueness validation with database enforcement when the invariant is authoritative, including tenant/scope/normalization semantics;
- use strict validation only when callers explicitly expect fail-fast exceptions;
- test lifecycle, contexts, conditions, error shape, persistence conflicts, associated failures, and bypass writers at their owning boundaries;
- treat direct/bulk writers as a validation bypass audit surface and make intentional validation bypasses explicit;
- never claim validation safety from valid? alone when alternate writers or database-level enforcement matter.
