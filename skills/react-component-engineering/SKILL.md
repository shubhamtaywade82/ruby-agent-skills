# React Component Engineering

## Purpose
Keep components small, explicit, composable, and aligned with a user-visible responsibility.

## Activate when
- creating or refactoring React components;
- designing props and composition;
- deciding controlled versus uncontrolled interfaces;
- reducing prop drilling or coupling.

## Repository inspection
Inspect component conventions, styling, routing/layout ownership, data-fetching infrastructure, design-system primitives, accessibility utilities, and test patterns.

## Decision rules
- Prefer semantic components with one clear responsibility.
- Prefer composition over boolean-prop explosion.
- Keep reusable components independent of application-specific data fetching where practical.
- Use controlled inputs when the parent owns state; use uncontrolled inputs when local DOM ownership is deliberate.
- Make loading, error, empty, and success states explicit.
- Keep important side effects outside purely presentational components.

## Implementation procedure
1. Define the component contract.
2. Separate data and state ownership from presentation.
3. Keep props minimal and intention-revealing.
4. Use composition for structural variation.
5. Add focused observable tests.
6. Verify keyboard and screen-reader behavior for interactive UI.

## Anti-patterns / failure modes
- components with unrelated responsibilities;
- dozens of boolean props;
- context used to hide ordinary dependency flow;
- reusable components tightly coupled to one endpoint;
- tests that assert internal implementation.

## Agent review checklist
- Does the component have one coherent responsibility?
- Is state/data ownership explicit?
- Could composition replace flag-driven branching?
- Are observable interaction and accessibility behaviors tested?

## Verification
Run focused component tests, typecheck, lint, and relevant application integration tests.
