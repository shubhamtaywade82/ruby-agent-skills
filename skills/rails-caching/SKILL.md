# Rails Caching Engineering

## Purpose
Treat caching as a correctness and systems-design boundary, not merely a performance switch.

`rails-performance` establishes the measurement and bottleneck discipline. This skill owns the caching contract itself:
- what may be cached;
- who may observe it;
- how stale it may be;
- how it is keyed and versioned;
- how it becomes invalid;
- what happens on miss or store failure;
- how concurrent recomputation is controlled;
- how the store behaves across processes and deployments.

Core flow:
measure cost -> define freshness/correctness -> choose cache layer -> design key/version -> define invalidation -> define miss/failure behavior -> bound stampede/capacity -> test isolation -> observe hit/miss/invalidation -> re-measure

## Activate when
- adding or changing Rails low-level, fragment, view, or HTTP caching;
- changing cache keys, namespaces, versions, or expiration;
- reviewing tenant/user/authorization isolation of cached data;
- investigating stale, incorrect, cross-user, or cross-tenant cached responses;
- reviewing cache invalidation after model/domain changes;
- diagnosing cache stampede, thundering-herd, hot-key, or eviction problems;
- configuring or reviewing Solid Cache;
- introducing cache warming or precomputation;
- changing cache stores, serialization, namespaces, or deployment topology;
- deciding whether a value should be cached at all;
- defining behavior when the cache is unavailable or inconsistent.

Do not activate solely because an endpoint is slow. First use `rails-performance` to establish whether caching is justified and which boundary owns the cost.

## Repository inspection
Inspect:
1. Ruby/Rails/runtime versions and the cache APIs available there;
2. configured cache store(s), namespaces, environment settings, and serializers;
3. existing cache key/version conventions;
4. model/domain ownership and update paths that can invalidate values;
5. authentication, authorization, and tenant boundaries;
6. fragment/response/low-level caching already in use;
7. background jobs or callbacks that perform warming/invalidation;
8. multi-process, multi-host, replica, or region topology;
9. deployment/versioning behavior;
10. metrics/logging for hit rate, miss rate, latency, evictions, errors, and stampede symptoms;
11. tests for cache behavior and isolation;
12. storage capacity, TTL, eviction, and serialization constraints.

Do not invent a new cache store or invalidation subsystem before inspecting the repository's current caching boundary.

## Cache suitability
Cache only when the workload and semantics justify it.

Before caching answer:
- what work is expensive?
- what freshness is acceptable?
- can stale data violate authorization, tenant isolation, financial correctness, or other invariants?
- can the value be reconstructed safely?
- what is the invalidation source of truth?
- what happens when the cache misses?
- what happens when the store is unavailable?
- what is the storage/serialization cost?

Prefer fixing an incorrect query, missing index, excessive object loading, or unnecessary computation before adding a cache when that change removes the underlying waste without stale-state semantics.

## Cache layers
Choose the layer that matches the contract:

- request/HTTP cache: cache the response when the entire representation can be shared safely;
- fragment cache: cache a presentation fragment with explicit dependency/version semantics;
- low-level/application cache: cache a computed or read-oriented value behind an explicit key contract;
- precomputed value: materialize expensive results when recomputation latency or load requires it.

Do not move a value to a broader cache layer merely because it has a higher hit-rate potential. Broader scope increases correctness and invalidation risk.

## Cache key contract
A cache key is part of the data contract.

Include every dimension required to distinguish valid results, such as:
- tenant/account;
- authenticated principal or authorization scope when applicable;
- locale/region;
- resource identity;
- query/filter/version inputs;
- feature/configuration version when output depends on it;
- representation/schema version when serialized shape changes.

Never place raw secrets or unnecessary sensitive values into keys or logs.

Keys should be deterministic, bounded, namespaced, and compatible with repository conventions.

Use `patterns/rails/cache-key-isolation.md` for explicit identity/isolation review.

## Versioning and deployment
Prefer deterministic versioning over ad-hoc mass deletion where the repository's cache model supports versioned keys.

Consider old/new application overlap:
- old workers may write old values;
- new readers may expect new shape;
- rolling deployment can produce mixed versions;
- serialized cached values may outlive the release that created them.

When representation or calculation semantics change, invalidate or version the affected key space intentionally.

Do not assume a cache flush is an acceptable deploy primitive. It can create a miss storm and erase unrelated warm state.

## Freshness and invalidation
Every non-trivial cache needs an explicit freshness contract.

Distinguish:
- expiration: value becomes invalid after time;
- event-driven invalidation: value becomes invalid after a domain change;
- versioned invalidation: changed inputs produce a new key/version;
- manual purge: operator-controlled removal with an explicit reason.

Prefer invalidation tied to the authoritative state transition rather than scattered controller callbacks.

Use `patterns/rails/cache-invalidation-contract.md` for non-trivial dependencies.

A short TTL is not a substitute for correct invalidation when stale data is unsafe.

## Miss behavior
Define what happens on a cache miss.

Normal miss:
read source -> compute/materialize -> store -> return

For expensive values also define:
- whether concurrent misses may recompute;
- whether stale data may be served;
- maximum wait/recompute budget;
- behavior when the source or cache store fails.

A cache miss must preserve the underlying data contract. Do not return an invalid success result merely because the cache is empty.

## Stampede and hot keys
Cache stampede is a concurrency/capacity problem.

Use `patterns/rails/cache-stampede-control.md` when concurrent recomputation is measured or the contract requires bounded recomputation.

Candidate controls include:
- stale-while-revalidate;
- bounded recomputation;
- request coalescing;
- prewarming;
- bounded locking;
- expiration jitter.

Choose the simplest mechanism that satisfies freshness and load requirements.

Do not add distributed locks because stampede is theoretically possible. Measure contention and cost first.

## Cache warming
Prewarming can trade deployment/load latency for background work.

Before warming define:
- which keys matter;
- expected hit-rate benefit;
- source-of-truth cost;
- concurrency/batch limit;
- failure/retry behavior;
- expiration timing;
- whether warming can overload the source database/API.

Warm only high-value keys backed by evidence. Avoid eager warming of unbounded key spaces.

## Failure behavior
A cache is normally an optimization boundary, so distinguish cache failure from source-of-truth failure.

Where correctness permits, cache-store failure should degrade to the underlying source with bounded extra load.

Where the cache is part of a required correctness or session contract, the failure semantics must be explicit instead of silently bypassing the boundary.

Never cache exceptions or authorization failures as successful values.

Use `patterns/rails/cache-failure-boundary.md` when the store failure mode affects user-visible behavior.

## Capacity and eviction
Treat cache storage as finite capacity.

Inspect:
- item size and serialization cost;
- TTL distribution;
- eviction policy;
- hot keys;
- namespace growth;
- value cardinality;
- network round trips;
- memory/CPU cost;
- cross-tenant key distribution.

A high hit rate can still be unhealthy if a small hot-key set creates contention or value size overwhelms the store.

Do not blindly increase TTL to improve hit rate; freshness and capacity may worsen.

## Security and isolation
Cached data can outlive the request that created it.

Verify:
- authorization-sensitive values are isolated;
- tenant/user dimensions are encoded when required;
- private responses are not exposed through shared caching;
- secrets/tokens are never cached unnecessarily;
- invalidation occurs when access rights change;
- cache logs and diagnostics do not expose payloads.

Coordinate with `rails-security` and `rails-security-engineering` for trust/tenant boundaries.

## Observability
At minimum, make the cache diagnosable without logging sensitive payloads.

Useful signals:
- hit/miss rate;
- get/set latency;
- store errors;
- evictions;
- entry size where measurable;
- hot-key concentration;
- stampede/recompute count;
- invalidation count/lag;
- source fallback rate.

Keep metric dimensions bounded. Do not use raw cache keys or user-generated identifiers as unbounded labels.

Coordinate with `rails-observability` for instrumentation and `rails-incident-engineering` for operational diagnosis.

## Testing
Cache tests should prove semantics, not implementation details.

Cover the applicable contract:
- hit and miss;
- key isolation;
- freshness/expiration;
- invalidation;
- version changes;
- authorization/tenant boundaries;
- concurrent miss behavior;
- store failure/fallback;
- serialization/deserialization;
- deployment compatibility where old/new processes overlap.

Prefer deterministic tests and repository-provided cache helpers.

## Reference example

A read-through cache entry with an explicit TTL and race-condition protection, keyed by the versioned record cache key.

```ruby
class InvoiceStats
  def self.for(account)
    Rails.cache.fetch(["invoice-stats/v2", account, account.invoices.maximum(:updated_at)],
                      expires_in: 15.minutes,
                      race_condition_ttl: 10.seconds) do
      {
        open_count: account.invoices.unpaid.count,
        overdue_cents: account.invoices.overdue.sum(:total_cents)
      }
    end
  end
end

# Key discipline:
#   - version the key namespace ("v2") so format changes cannot serve stale shapes
#   - embed the max(updated_at) so the entry self-invalidates on writes
#   - never cache a value whose authorization depends on the current viewer
```

## Agent review checklist
- [ ] workload and bottleneck evidence exists
- [ ] cache layer matches the sharing/freshness contract
- [ ] key contains required identity/version dimensions
- [ ] tenant/authorization isolation is explicit
- [ ] freshness semantics are documented
- [ ] invalidation owner is explicit
- [ ] miss behavior is correct
- [ ] stampede control is justified by evidence
- [ ] warming is bounded
- [ ] store failure semantics are explicit
- [ ] capacity/eviction effects are understood
- [ ] deployment overlap is safe
- [ ] observability avoids sensitive payloads
- [ ] deterministic tests cover the cache contract

## Anti-patterns
- caching before measuring the underlying cost;
- keys that omit tenant/user/authorization identity;
- TTL used as the only correctness mechanism for sensitive data;
- controller-by-controller invalidation for a domain-owned value;
- global cache flush on every deploy;
- unbounded cache warming;
- distributed locks for unmeasured stampede risk;
- caching exceptions or authorization failures as successful data;
- treating cache-store outages as indistinguishable from source-of-truth outages;
- unbounded cache metrics labels;
- declaring a cache correct from hit-rate alone.

## Verification
Verify both functional correctness and cache behavior.

Use this evidence format where relevant:
workload: ...
baseline: ...
cache_layer: ...
key_contract: ...
freshness: ...
invalidation: ...
hit/miss: ...
failure_behavior: ...
after: ...

Never claim that caching improved production performance without measurement or a structurally demonstrated reduction in repeated work.

## Rails 8 current framework considerations

- Solid Cache is the default cache store for new Rails 8 applications and uses database-backed storage. Inspect cache database ownership, capacity, isolation, and migration conventions before relying on it.
- Do not equate database-backed cache storage with authoritative application data; cache invalidation and failure semantics remain separate concerns.
