# React Data Fetching

## Purpose
Separate server state from local UI state and make request identity, freshness, error behavior, cancellation, and mutation consistency explicit.

## Activate when
- adding API calls to React;
- introducing query or cache infrastructure;
- implementing mutations or optimistic updates;
- fixing duplicate, stale, or racing requests.

## Repository inspection
Inspect the existing HTTP client, query/cache library, cache-key conventions, authentication context, retry policy, error model, and test utilities.

## Decision rules
- Prefer repository-standard fetching infrastructure.
- Treat query keys as cache identity.
- Make freshness and invalidation explicit when current data matters.
- Cancel or ignore obsolete requests when ordering matters.
- Optimistic updates require a rollback path.
- Distinguish loading, refreshing, error, empty, and success states.
- Never use cached UI state as authorization evidence.

## Implementation procedure
1. Identify query identity and owner.
2. Define freshness and invalidation.
3. Define error and retry behavior.
4. Define mutation consistency and rollback.
5. Add race and cache-invalidation tests.
6. Verify authentication and tenant context at the network boundary.

## Anti-patterns / failure modes
- one cache key for unrelated parameterized resources;
- automatic retries for non-idempotent mutations;
- optimistic UI without rollback;
- duplicated fetching logic in leaf components;
- server state placed in global UI context only for reachability.

## Agent review checklist
- Is server-state ownership separate from local UI state?
- Do cache keys include every resource-identity dimension?
- Are retries and mutations safe for their semantics?
- Is rollback or reconciliation explicit for optimistic updates?

## Verification
Test initial load, refetch, failure, cancellation, cache hit, invalidation, mutation success, and mutation failure.
