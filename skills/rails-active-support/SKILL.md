# Rails Active Support Engineering

## Purpose

Treat Active Support as a reusable framework foundation, not as a miscellaneous bag of convenience methods.

Active Support provides Rails utility classes, Ruby extensions, and cross-cutting framework primitives. The current Rails guides document both selective core-extension loading and an instrumentation API; current APIs also cover Concern composition, inheritable class attributes, and request-scoped CurrentAttributes. citeturn653037search0turn399121search0turn354157view0turn399121search1turn354157view2

This skill owns:

- core extension/loading boundaries;
- ActiveSupport::Concern composition;
- reusable class/module configuration;
- class_attribute inheritance and mutation semantics;
- CurrentAttributes and request/execution context;
- generic ActiveSupport callbacks;
- ActiveSupport::Notifications event contracts;
- time/date/time-zone utility boundaries;
- inflector/reflection use at security-sensitive boundaries;
- deterministic testing of Active Support primitives.

It composes with:

- rails-observability for operational telemetry and production diagnostics;
- ruby-concurrency for thread/fiber safety;
- rails-active-model and rails-activerecord for model lifecycle behavior;
- rails-zeitwerk for autoloading and constant loading;
- rails-i18n for localized rendering and translation;
- rails-testing / rails-test-engineering for test boundaries;
- rails-security / rails-security-engineering for dynamic constantization, context isolation, and untrusted input.

## Activate when

- adding or changing ActiveSupport::Concern modules;
- introducing class_attribute or inheritable configuration;
- adding CurrentAttributes or request-scoped global context;
- creating custom ActiveSupport callbacks;
- instrumenting application code with ActiveSupport::Notifications;
- selecting or cherry-picking Active Support core extensions;
- changing Time.zone/date/time utility behavior;
- using Active Support inflection or constantize/safe_constantize;
- reviewing monkey patches/core extensions;
- debugging framework behavior caused by Active Support utilities.

Do not activate for a generic Ruby utility that does not use Active Support semantics.

## Repository inspection

Inspect before implementation:

1. Ruby/Rails/Active Support versions;
2. existing Active Support imports and initializers;
3. current concerns and dependency relationships;
4. class_attribute/configuration conventions;
5. Current/current-user/request-context conventions;
6. callback definitions and lifecycle owners;
7. existing ActiveSupport::Notifications events/subscribers;
8. Time.zone and date/time conventions;
9. inflections and dynamic constantization;
10. rails-observability and logging conventions;
11. test helpers and isolation/reset behavior.

Search for an existing local abstraction before creating another concern, context object, instrumentation event, or configuration macro.

## Core extensions and loading

Active Support can be loaded selectively: active_support/core_ext/some_class, a specific extension file, all core extensions, or active_support/all. Rails applications normally load Active Support unless active_support.bare is configured. citeturn653037search0

Choose the narrowest loading boundary that is practical.

Prefer:

- existing Rails-provided loading in normal Rails application code;
- targeted requires in standalone Ruby libraries;
- explicit dependency declarations for gems that use Active Support outside Rails.

Avoid:

- requiring active_support/all inside a focused reusable library without a reason;
- assuming a core extension exists merely because it exists in a Rails application;
- creating duplicate monkey patches for a method already provided by Active Support.

Treat a core extension as a compatibility dependency.

## ActiveSupport::Concern

ActiveSupport::Concern provides dependency-aware module composition plus included/prepended blocks and class_methods. Rails documents it as a way to encapsulate reusable behavior and correctly resolve module dependencies. citeturn354157view0

Use a concern when:

- behavior is cohesive;
- multiple classes share the same protocol;
- the host class remains the clear owner of the domain behavior;
- the dependency is a reusable cross-cutting trait.

Prefer an explicit object/service when:

- the behavior has substantial state;
- several unrelated dependencies are injected;
- the module would need many callbacks/macros;
- inclusion changes surprising public APIs;
- the concern becomes a hidden inheritance layer.

Keep concern dependencies explicit.

Do not build "god concerns" that contain unrelated callbacks, queries, validations, authorization, serialization, and callbacks in one module.

Prefer namespaced, narrow concerns with a clear host contract.

## class_attribute and reusable configuration

Active Support's class_attribute provides inheritable class-level values that subclasses can override without mutating the parent configuration. Current Rails also provides options for instance accessors and defaults. citeturn399121search1

Use class_attribute for configuration that is intentionally inherited/overridden.

Define:

- owner;
- default;
- inheritance semantics;
- mutation API;
- whether instances may read/write;
- mutability of the value.

Beware mutable defaults.

Prefer immutable values or copy-on-write update patterns for arrays/hashes.

Do not use class_attribute as hidden mutable global application state.

When configuration varies per request/user/tenant, use explicit context rather than class_attribute.

## CurrentAttributes and execution context

CurrentAttributes exposes thread-isolated singleton-like request attributes and resets them around requests. Rails' current API also supports reset hooks for related context such as Time.zone. citeturn354157view2

Use CurrentAttributes only for narrow request/execution context that would otherwise have to be threaded through a large number of layers.

Good candidates include:

- current authenticated account/user;
- request ID/correlation data;
- request-local tenant;
- request-local locale/context.

Keep the context small.

Do not put business state, arbitrary caches, domain aggregates, or long-lived configuration in CurrentAttributes.

Explicitly define:

- who sets each attribute;
- reset boundary;
- job handoff behavior;
- thread/fiber/concurrency behavior;
- test reset behavior;
- whether nested execution needs copied context.

Never assume CurrentAttributes automatically propagates into every background job, thread, or external process boundary.

Prefer explicit job arguments for durable work.

## ActiveSupport::Callbacks

ActiveSupport::Callbacks provides generic lifecycle callback infrastructure used by Rails components.

Use generic callbacks when:

- a class owns a clear lifecycle protocol;
- callbacks are part of a reusable framework contract;
- before/around/after semantics are genuinely useful.

Prefer explicit method orchestration when the lifecycle becomes business workflow.

Define:

- callback event names;
- ordering;
- halting/abort behavior;
- around callback nesting;
- failure semantics;
- instrumentation;
- test isolation.

Do not use callbacks to hide network calls, transactions, authorization, or unrelated business workflows.

## ActiveSupport::Notifications

ActiveSupport::Notifications provides instrumentation for Ruby/Rails code. Events have names and arbitrary payloads; subscribers can observe duration, allocations, payloads, and exceptions. Rails recommends a library-oriented event naming convention such as event.library. citeturn354157view1turn399121search0

For custom events define:

- stable event name;
- owner/library namespace;
- payload schema;
- units and meanings;
- low-cardinality identifiers;
- sensitive-data filtering;
- exception semantics;
- subscriber lifecycle.

Prefer:

    domain.operation
    component.action

over opaque or user-derived event names.

Use monotonic subscriptions when elapsed duration accuracy matters. citeturn354157view1

Do not use instrumentation as the business event bus.

Do not make subscribers mutate authoritative domain state.

Do not place secrets, raw request bodies, credentials, or high-cardinality user data into every payload.

Compose with rails-observability for metrics/logging/tracing export.

## Time and date semantics

Active Support extends Ruby date/time behavior and supplies time-zone aware Rails APIs.

Before using time helpers decide:

- wall-clock versus elapsed/monotonic time;
- UTC persistence versus local presentation;
- Time.zone versus system timezone;
- date versus timestamp semantics;
- daylight-saving behavior;
- beginning/end-of-period semantics.

Prefer Time.zone-aware application logic where Rails local time matters.

Persist durable timestamps in the repository's authoritative timezone convention.

Do not use local wall-clock time for duration measurement; use monotonic timing where elapsed accuracy matters, including Notifications monotonic subscriptions. citeturn354157view1

Never convert a timezone choice into authorization or tenant identity.

## Inflection and dynamic constantization

Active Support inflections provide Rails naming conventions and utilities such as singularize/pluralize and constantization helpers.

Treat dynamic constantization as a security-sensitive boundary.

Rules:

- prefer an explicit allowlisted mapping for external/user-controlled values;
- use safe_constantize only when missing constants are genuinely expected;
- do not constantize arbitrary request parameters into executable classes;
- keep autoloading/constant-loading concerns with rails-zeitwerk;
- test irregular inflections that affect routes, serializers, or persistence names.

Inflection configuration is global application behavior; change it narrowly and test the affected names.

## Reusable Active Support utilities

Use Active Support utilities when they make an existing Rails contract clearer.

Examples include:

- HashWithIndifferentAccess where mixed symbol/string-key APIs are intentional;
- with_options for grouped option construction;
- class_attribute for inherited configuration;
- concern utilities for reusable module composition;
- inflection helpers for framework naming;
- core extensions such as blank?/present?/presence where the repository already expects Rails semantics.

Do not introduce Active Support extensions merely to shorten code.

Keep utility semantics visible at important domain/security boundaries.

## Security and concurrency

Active Support primitives can hide global or shared state.

Review:

- class-level configuration mutation;
- CurrentAttributes leakage;
- thread/fiber isolation;
- callback side effects;
- notification payload exposure;
- dynamic constantization;
- global inflection changes;
- monkey patches.

When state is mutable, define the owner and lifecycle.

For any request-local state, prove reset/isolation behavior.

For concurrent code, compose with ruby-concurrency and test race-sensitive behavior explicitly.

## Testing

Test at the smallest owning boundary:

- targeted core-extension availability;
- Concern dependency and included/prepended behavior;
- class_attribute inheritance and mutation isolation;
- CurrentAttributes set/reset/isolation behavior;
- callback order/halting/around semantics;
- notification name/payload/duration/error contracts;
- time-zone and DST boundaries;
- inflection and constantization allowlists;
- test isolation across examples.

Use temporary Notifications subscriptions sparingly; the Rails API notes that temporary subscription can affect internal caches and performance, so long-lived subscribers are preferred for normal instrumentation. citeturn354157view1

Do not rely on global state left behind by another test.

## Anti-patterns / failure modes

- requiring active_support/all inside a focused reusable library without need;
- god concerns;
- hidden dependencies between concerns;
- mutable class_attribute configuration shared across subclasses;
- using class_attribute for request/tenant state;
- putting business state into CurrentAttributes;
- assuming CurrentAttributes propagates into background jobs automatically;
- using callbacks as hidden application workflows;
- notification subscribers mutating authoritative state;
- high-cardinality or sensitive notification payloads;
- using wall-clock time to measure durations;
- constantizing untrusted strings;
- changing global inflections to fix one local naming bug;
- relying on global Active Support state in tests without reset.

## Verification

For an Active Support change:

    runtime/version evidence
    -> loading boundary
    -> composition/configuration primitive
    -> state/concurrency semantics
    -> lifecycle/callback semantics
    -> instrumentation contract
    -> time/inflection semantics
    -> security review
    -> focused tests
    -> regression verification

Never claim a CurrentAttributes value is request-safe, a notification is production-safe, or a concern is reusable merely because the code compiles. Verify lifecycle, isolation, payload, and consumer contracts.
