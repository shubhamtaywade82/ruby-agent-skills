# Ruby Debugging

## Purpose

Turn an observed failure into a verified root cause and a regression-safe fix.

## Activate when

- an exception or failing test exists
- behavior is incorrect but the code appears plausible
- a production issue needs diagnosis
- logs do not explain an intermittent problem
- state becomes invalid somewhere upstream of the failure

## Repository inspection

Before debugging, inspect the repository context and then collect evidence:


Collect:

- exact error/message
- full relevant stack trace
- request/input
- relevant state
- Ruby/Rails/dependency versions
- recent changes
- reproducibility
- logs/metrics/traces available to the repository

Do not start by changing code.

## Debugging loop

```text
reproduce
  -> observe
  -> isolate
  -> inspect state
  -> form hypothesis
  -> test hypothesis
  -> patch root cause
  -> add regression coverage
  -> verify
```

A hypothesis should predict what evidence will change if it is correct.

## Stack traces

The exception location is where failure surfaced, not necessarily where invalid state was created.

Trace backwards through:

- arguments
- collaborators
- data loading
- normalization
- callbacks
- persistence
- external responses

## Logging

Good diagnostic logs identify:

- operation
- correlation/request identifier when available
- relevant domain identifier
- meaningful state transition

Do not log passwords, credentials, bearer tokens, secrets, or full sensitive payloads.

## Interactive debugging

Use the repository's supported debugger (`debug`, `byebug`, IDE tooling, etc.).

Inspect:

- receiver
- locals
- instance variables
- stack
- branch state
- database/external responses where relevant

## Intermittent failures

Look for:

- concurrency
- time
- ordering
- retries
- external dependency behavior
- shared mutable state
- database isolation/transactions

Avoid "fixes" that only add sleeps or retries without evidence.

## Fix discipline

Prefer the smallest root-cause fix that preserves unrelated behavior.

Then add a regression test that would have failed before the fix.

## Verification ladder

1. reproduce original failure
2. run focused regression test
3. run affected test group
4. run broader suite when appropriate
5. inspect final diff

If a check cannot be run, state that explicitly.

## Agent review checklist

- [ ] evidence captured
- [ ] hypothesis tested
- [ ] root cause distinguished from symptom
- [ ] regression test added/updated
- [ ] no sensitive data logged
- [ ] original reproduction now passes
- [ ] broader regression checked

## Verification

Use deterministic reproductions where possible. For production-only failures, capture the observed evidence and create the narrowest safe reproduction available.

## Source foundation

Based on the logging and debugging material in *The Ruby Workshop*. The evidence-first and regression-oriented approach is aligned with the testing/refactoring discipline of *Clean Ruby*.
