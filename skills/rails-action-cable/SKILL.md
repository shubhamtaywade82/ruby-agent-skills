# Rails Action Cable & Realtime Engineering

## Purpose

Treat Action Cable as a realtime distributed boundary rather than another controller endpoint.

Action Cable introduces long-lived WebSocket connections, channel subscriptions, pub/sub broadcastings, client reconnect behavior, and a separate runtime/capacity profile from ordinary request-response Rails.

Core flow:

```text
connection authentication
-> subscription authorization
-> explicit channel identity
-> bounded stream
-> domain event/state change
-> broadcast contract
-> client delivery
-> reconnect/resubscribe
-> observable lifecycle
```

Rails documents Action Cable around connections, consumers, channels, subscriptions, streams, and broadcastings. Broadcastings are online/time-dependent rather than durable message queues; clients that are not subscribed when a broadcast is emitted do not receive that past broadcast.

## Activate when
- configuring or reviewing Solid Cable as the Action Cable pub/sub backend

- adding or changing `ApplicationCable::Connection`;
- adding or changing an Action Cable channel;
- implementing `subscribed`, `unsubscribed`, or channel actions;
- adding `stream_from`, `stream_for`, or `broadcast_to`;
- exposing realtime notifications, dashboards, collaboration, chat, presence, or live status;
- changing WebSocket authentication or authorization;
- configuring Action Cable adapters or Redis/pub/sub;
- diagnosing dropped connections, duplicate subscriptions, missed broadcasts, or reconnect storms;
- changing Action Cable deployment/process capacity;
- reviewing channel parameters, tenant isolation, or client-controlled stream names;
- testing Action Cable subscriptions/broadcasts;
- deciding whether data belongs in durable messaging instead of realtime delivery.

Do not activate merely because a normal controller emits JSON. Use `rails-api-integration` or ordinary Rails request skills unless a WebSocket/realtime boundary exists.

## Repository inspection

Inspect before changing realtime behavior:

1. Ruby/Rails version and Action Cable APIs available in that version;
2. `ApplicationCable::Connection` and connection identifiers;
3. `ApplicationCable::Channel` and existing channel hierarchy;
4. channel subscription parameters and authorization conventions;
5. current_user/current_account/tenant resolution;
6. cookie/session/token authentication used by WebSockets;
7. Action Cable URL, allowed origins, mount path, and environment configuration;
8. subscription adapter and Redis/pub/sub topology;
9. stream naming and `stream_from` / `stream_for` usage;
10. broadcast producers and event/state ownership;
11. client-side consumers/subscriptions and reconnect behavior;
12. queue/job/event sources that trigger broadcasts;
13. deployment process model, worker/web concurrency, memory, and Redis capacity;
14. logging, metrics, connection lifecycle telemetry, and incident diagnostics;
15. existing channel/system/integration tests;
16. fallback behavior when realtime delivery is unavailable.

Do not introduce a parallel realtime framework or custom WebSocket transport without repository evidence that Action Cable cannot satisfy the contract.

## Decision rules

1. Classify the change: connection authentication and lifecycle, channel/subscription authorization, streams and broadcasts, delivery and reconnect semantics, fan-out and capacity, adapter topology and failure, or security/operations/testing.
2. Load the matching reference below before changing behavior; any new channel or stream needs the authorization reference.
3. Keep connection authentication separate from per-channel/resource authorization, and re-authorize at subscription time.

## Critical invariants

- Authentication proves identity; it does not grant subscription access.
- Never let a client select a broadcast namespace that it could not otherwise authorize.
- Do not use Action Cable as a durable queue.
- Do not claim a single broadcast after reconnect repairs all missed state.
- When a message represents committed database state, coordinate the broadcast with transaction semantics.

## References

Load only the reference for the boundary being changed, before changing behavior there. Each reference is self-contained and one level deep; none links to another. Consult a listed pattern from the pattern catalog only when the change needs its implementation shape.

## Reference example

A channel that authorizes the subscription before streaming, and pairs an implicit resource stream with an explicit lifecycle stream.

```ruby
class RoomChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  def subscribed
    room = Room.find_by(id: params[:room_id])
    return reject unless room && current_user.member_of?(room)

    stream_for room                      # broadcast_to(room, ...) reaches these subscribers
    stream_from "room:#{room.id}:system" # explicit stream for join/leave lifecycle events
  end

  def unsubscribed
    StopPresenceTrackingJob.perform_later(current_user.id, params[:room_id])
  end
end

# Server-side broadcast after a state change (never trust the client to echo state):
# RoomBroadcastJob.perform_later(room)  ->  RoomChannel.broadcast_to(room, payload)
```

## Agent review checklist

- [ ] runtime/Action Cable version resolved
- [ ] connection authentication identified
- [ ] channel authorization identified
- [ ] tenant/resource ownership verified
- [ ] channel parameters validated
- [ ] stream names bounded and isolated
- [ ] broadcast payload contract explicit
- [ ] realtime versus durable semantics explicit
- [ ] reconnect/resubscribe behavior defined
- [ ] state reconciliation defined
- [ ] transaction/broadcast ordering reviewed
- [ ] client actions treated as API boundaries
- [ ] fan-out and payload size measured
- [ ] WebSocket capacity estimated
- [ ] Redis/adapter topology reviewed
- [ ] failure/degradation semantics explicit
- [ ] allowed origins/security reviewed
- [ ] deploy/restart lifecycle reviewed
- [ ] lifecycle/broadcast telemetry bounded
- [ ] deterministic tests cover auth, isolation, subscription, and broadcast behavior

## Anti-patterns / failure modes

- authentication without channel authorization;
- client-selected arbitrary stream names;
- blob/resource IDs treated as authorization;
- broadcasting private data to broad tenant/global streams;
- using Action Cable as a durable queue;
- assuming disconnected clients receive missed broadcasts;
- broadcasting entire Active Record objects;
- domain writes embedded directly in channel callbacks;
- broadcast before committed state;
- unbounded per-record broadcast callbacks;
- ignoring Redis/pub/sub capacity;
- testing against live Redis in every CI run;
- synchronized reconnect storms after deployment;
- logging secrets or sensitive payloads;
- using raw user IDs or stream names as unbounded telemetry labels;
- making optional realtime delivery a hidden database transaction dependency.

## Verification

For a realtime feature:

```text
connection auth
-> channel authorization
-> stream contract
-> broadcast contract
-> state/reconciliation semantics
-> focused Action Cable tests
-> capacity model
-> security checks
-> deploy/reconnect verification
-> regression suite
```

For production incidents verify whether failure occurred at:

```text
client
-> WebSocket connection
-> authentication
-> subscription
-> pub/sub adapter
-> broadcast producer
-> serialization
-> client consumer
```

Never claim realtime delivery, fan-out capacity, or reconnect safety without runtime evidence.

## Rails 8 current framework considerations

- Solid Cable provides a database-backed pub/sub option for Action Cable. Treat its retention, polling/pub/sub capacity, failure behavior, and deployment topology as runtime concerns.
- Preserve the same authorization, stream identity, reconciliation, and overload protections regardless of whether Redis or Solid Cable is the transport.

## Rails Action Cable changes

For Action Cable/realtime changes:
- inspect ApplicationCable::Connection, channel hierarchy, subscription parameters, stream naming, broadcast producers, client reconnect behavior, adapter/Redis configuration, process topology, capacity, and tests before implementation;
- keep WebSocket connection authentication separate from per-channel/resource authorization;
- treat all channel parameters and client actions as untrusted API input;
- authorize subscriptions through the owning resource/tenant and never treat a blob/resource ID or stream name as authorization;
- use bounded deterministic stream names and prefer framework resource primitives such as stream_for/broadcast_to when appropriate;
- treat broadcast payloads as versioned wire contracts and avoid serializing entire Active Record objects or sensitive fields;
- do not use Action Cable as durable messaging; define reconnect/refetch reconciliation when missed broadcasts matter;
- coordinate broadcasts with committed state and use outbox/durable event infrastructure when delivery correctness requires it;
- size WebSocket connections, subscriptions, message rate, payload bytes, Redis/pubsub, memory, CPU, and reconnect bursts separately from HTTP capacity;
- define degraded behavior when Redis/Action Cable is unavailable rather than making optional realtime delivery an accidental transaction dependency;
- review allowed origins, credential/session lifetime, tenant isolation, secrets, and sensitive payloads;
- avoid synchronized reconnect storms during deploys and test connection/channel/broadcast behavior with deterministic local adapters;
- never claim realtime delivery or capacity without runtime evidence.
