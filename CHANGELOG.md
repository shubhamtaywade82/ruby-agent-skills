## Iteration 106 — Independent Release Archive Verification

- Add a standalone release archive verifier independent of the archive builder's self-test.
- Verify release metadata, skill/pattern inventory, required agent-facing paths, archive safety, and optional published SHA-256 checksums.
- Add regression coverage and wire the verifier into `bin/validate`.

# Changelog

## Iteration 105 — Release Infrastructure

- Add `scripts/build_release_archive.rb`: deterministic, reproducible release archive with embedded `RELEASE.json` provenance, SHA-256 checksums, and generated release notes.
- Extend `bin/install` with offline archive support: a plain local directory (an extracted release archive) installs directly without git, recording release provenance; the installer also self-detects when it runs from an extracted archive or a repository checkout.
- Add `.github/workflows/release.yml`: tag-triggered release CI that validates, builds, self-tests, checks reproducibility, and publishes the GitHub Release with archive and checksums.
- Add `test/release_archive_system_test.rb` covering archive contents, provenance, offline install, verification, and reproducibility.
- Add `RELEASE.md` documenting the release definition and process; document offline archive installs in `docs/INSTALLATION.md` and `README.md`.

## Iteration 104 — Verified Routing History Boundary

- Reject history entries whose archive paths resolve outside the declared archive root.
- Record archive-manifest SHA-256 provenance for every indexed archive.
- Add an aggregate archive-set SHA-256 to generated history and verify it during replay.
- Add regression coverage for archive-root escape and provenance requirements.

## Iteration 103 — Release Bundle Component Provenance

- Bind bundled public evidence to its archive manifest by source-evidence hash and shared campaign/repository/agent identity.
- Require optional matrix evidence to match the public campaign and repository revision.
- Add regression coverage for release component identity binding.

## Iteration 102 — Documentation Consistency Contract

- Add a deterministic documentation audit covering README, implementation handoff, changelog milestone, filesystem inventory, and manifest identity.
- Make `bin/validate` enforce documentation consistency before release readiness.
- Synchronize current inventory and implementation-status documentation with the verified Iteration 101 repository state.

## Iteration 101 — Verified Routing History

- Add `routing-history --verify` for integrity-gated longitudinal history generation.
- Validate every indexed archive against its independent archive verifier and manifest identity.
- Keep historical model reporting descriptive-only.
