# Changelog

## Iteration 110 — Multi-Region Data Boundary Pattern

- Add the `multi-region-data-boundary` implementation pattern: region routing, authoritative write ownership, data-residency enforcement at the storage layer, replication lag budgets, fenced failover with stated RPO/RTO, and conflict handling for the failover window.
- Wire the pattern into the `rails-distributed-systems` skill (design guidance, review checklist, and anti-pattern), the skill manifest (registry path plus multi-region/data-residency/region-failover triggers), and the router pattern-selection matrix.
- Correct the README validation-suite prose summary to the actual system/contract test count (82), closing a prose-only drift the inventory table guard could not see.

## Iteration 109 — Release Documentation Polish

- Deduplicate the repeated Iteration 95–97 sections in the README and restore a single ordered iteration narrative (92–104) including the previously orphaned Iteration 98 entry.
- Refresh the README "Current implementation status" section to the current milestone, including the release infrastructure: reproducible checksummed archives, offline installation, the tag-triggered release workflow, and published GitHub releases.
- Add a README quick start with the direct release-archive download, git checkout, and installation verification commands; link the Installation section to the releases page.

## Iteration 108 — Release Artifact Verification

- Add standalone `scripts/verify_release_archive.rb` with archive-safety and content-integrity checks.
- Add regression coverage for tampered archives, metadata, and unsafe entries.

## Iteration 107 — Release File-Level Provenance

- Add deterministic file-level SHA-256 and byte-size provenance to `RELEASE.json`.

## Iteration 106 — Release Verification Gate

- Gate tag-triggered release publication on independent release archive verification after the offline installation self-test.

## Iteration 105 — Release Infrastructure

- Add `scripts/build_release_archive.rb`: deterministic, reproducible release archive with embedded `RELEASE.json` provenance, SHA-256 checksums, and generated release notes.
- Extend `bin/install` with offline archive support: a plain local directory (an extracted release archive) installs directly without git, recording release provenance; the installer also self-detects when it runs from an extracted archive or a repository checkout.
- Add `.github/workflows/release.yml`: tag-triggered release CI that validates, builds, self-tests, checks reproducibility, and publishes the GitHub Release with archive and checksums.
- Add `test/release_archive_system_test.rb` covering archive contents, provenance, offline install, verification, and reproducibility.
- Add `RELEASE.md` documenting the release definition and process; document offline archive installs in `docs/INSTALLATION.md` and `README.md`.

## Iteration 104 — Verified Routing History Boundary

- Reject history entries whose archive paths resolve outside the declared archive root.
- Record archive-manifest SHA-256 provenance for every indexed archive.
- Add an aggregate archive-set SHA-256 to generated history and verify it during replay.
- Add regression coverage for archive-root escape and provenance requirements.

## Iteration 103 — Release Bundle Component Provenance

- Bind bundled public evidence to its archive manifest by source-evidence hash and shared campaign/repository/agent identity.
- Require optional matrix evidence to match the public campaign and repository revision.
- Add regression coverage for release component identity binding.

## Iteration 102 — Documentation Consistency Contract

- Add a deterministic documentation audit covering README, implementation handoff, changelog milestone, filesystem inventory, and manifest identity.
- Make `bin/validate` enforce documentation consistency before release readiness.
- Synchronize current inventory and implementation-status documentation with the verified Iteration 101 repository state.

## Iteration 101 — Verified Routing History

- Add `routing-history --verify` for integrity-gated longitudinal history generation.
- Validate every indexed archive against its independent archive verifier and manifest identity.
- Keep historical model reporting descriptive-only.
