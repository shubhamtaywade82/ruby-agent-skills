# Hotwire Testing

## Problem
Tests validate only rendered HTML or only the browser, leaving protocol and lifecycle defects undetected.

## Use when
Changing frames, streams, forms, navigation lifecycle, or Stimulus controllers.

## Required cases
Frame response contract, stream actions, status/redirect behavior, authorization, CSRF, controller lifecycle cleanup, and stable target identity.

## Review checklist
Use the smallest deterministic boundary that proves the behavior and add a browser/system test when DOM lifecycle is essential.
## Do not use when
The change has no Hotwire or browser lifecycle contract.

## Repository inspection
Inspect request/system tests, JavaScript test setup, browser drivers, Turbo helpers, and deterministic fixtures.

## Implementation procedure
Test the smallest protocol boundary first, then add browser/system verification when DOM lifecycle is essential.

## Failure modes
Only testing snapshots, only testing JavaScript, timing flakes, and missing authorization coverage.

## Testing
Cover frame and stream contracts, status/redirect behavior, security failures, and Stimulus lifecycle cleanup.

## Review checklist
Tests prove both server protocol and client lifecycle behavior where applicable.
