# Stimulus Lifecycle Boundary

## Problem
Turbo reconnection duplicates listeners, timers, observers, or subscriptions.

## Structure
Allocate resources in connect and release them in disconnect; make repeated lifecycle transitions safe.

## Testing
Exercise repeated lifecycle transitions and cleanup.
## Do not use when
The controller owns no resource that requires cleanup.

## Repository inspection
Inspect connect/disconnect hooks, event listeners, timers, observers, subscriptions, and Turbo replacement paths.

## Implementation procedure
Acquire external resources in connect, release them in disconnect, and make repeated cycles safe.

## Failure modes
Duplicate handlers, memory leaks, stale subscriptions, and work continuing after disconnect.

## Testing
Run repeated connect/disconnect cycles and verify cleanup.

## Review checklist
Every acquired resource has a deterministic release path.

## Use when

Use this pattern when the described Hotwire interaction is an explicit part of the page contract and its lifecycle needs dedicated guidance.
