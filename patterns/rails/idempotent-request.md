# Idempotent Request

## Problem

A client may submit the same mutation more than once because of retries, timeouts, or duplicate delivery.

## Use when

Designing mutation APIs where duplicate execution is materially harmful or expensive.

## Do not use when

The operation is read-only or duplicate execution is explicitly harmless.

## Repository inspection

Inspect request authentication, persistence, uniqueness constraints, transaction boundaries, existing idempotency keys, client conventions, and database version/adapter.

## Implementation procedure

1. Define idempotency-key scope.
2. Bind scope to principal/tenant where required.
3. Persist the key, request fingerprint, and result in a durable boundary.
4. Return the original outcome or an explicit conflict for duplicates.
5. Serialize concurrent duplicates using database/transaction boundaries.
6. Reject key reuse with different request semantics where required.
7. Define retention/expiry.
8. Test sequential and concurrent replay.

## Failure modes

- process-local idempotency state
- key not scoped to client/tenant
- side effect before idempotency state is committed
- inconsistent replay result
- same key accepted for different payloads
- assuming uniqueness validation alone creates idempotency

## Testing

Test first request, exact replay, same-key/different-payload, concurrent duplicate, failure-then-retry, and expiry behavior where applicable.

## Review checklist

- [ ] key scope explicit
- [ ] durable state
- [ ] fingerprint semantics explicit
- [ ] transaction boundary explicit
- [ ] duplicate result explicit
- [ ] concurrent duplicates tested
- [ ] retention policy defined
