# Idempotent Job

## Problem
Retries, redelivery, operator replay, or deployment recovery can execute a job more than once.

## Use when
A job performs durable or externally visible side effects.

## Do not use when
The job is provably pure and repeatable without side effects.

## Implementation procedure
1. Identify every side effect.
2. Define the duplicate-execution scenario.
3. Choose a durable idempotency key or state invariant.
4. Enforce uniqueness at the database/external API boundary when possible.
5. Keep the job retryable without corrupting state.
6. Test the duplicate path explicitly.

## Failure modes
- process-local mutex used as distributed idempotency
- check-then-act race without database constraint
- marking complete before the side effect
- retrying an external charge without an idempotency key

## Testing
Execute the job twice with the same logical input and assert the externally visible result occurs once.

## Review checklist
- durable key/invariant exists
- race is closed
- retry path is safe
- duplicate execution is tested

## Repository inspection

Inspect the repository's runtime/version, existing conventions, neighboring tests or implementation patterns, and the actual owning boundary before applying this pattern.
