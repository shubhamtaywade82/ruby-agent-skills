# Alert Actionability

## Problem
Alerts that lack an operator action increase noise without shortening detection or mitigation time.

## Use when
- adding or reviewing paging/alert rules;
- reducing alert fatigue;
- converting raw telemetry into operational signals.

## Do not use when
- selecting ordinary application log messages;
- no operator action is associated with the signal.

## Repository inspection
Inspect SLOs, existing alerts, alert routing, dashboards, severity definitions, suppression/deduplication, and ownership.

## Implementation procedure
1. Identify the contract protected. 2. Define the signal/window. 3. Define severity. 4. Attach diagnostic links/context. 5. Define immediate operator action. 6. Define recovery/resolution. 7. Test firing, deduplication, and resolution.

## Failure modes
- paging on every exception;
- alerting on non-actionable metrics;
- missing ownership;
- alerts with no recovery condition;
- sensitive payloads embedded in notifications.

## Testing
Use deterministic metric or event fixtures to test fire, suppression/deduplication, and recovery behavior.

## Review checklist
- [ ] actionable; - [ ] user/system contract named; - [ ] owner; - [ ] diagnostic context; - [ ] recovery condition; - [ ] bounded sensitivity.
