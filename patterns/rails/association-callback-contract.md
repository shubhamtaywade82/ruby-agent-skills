# Association Callback Contract

## Problem

Association callbacks can hide mutation-time business rules and side effects behind collection operations.

## Use when

- adding association callbacks
- debugging collection mutation
- enforcing local collection limits.

## Do not use when

- the workflow spans multiple aggregates or external systems.

## Repository inspection

Inspect collection mutation methods, callback order, abort behavior, transactions, and tests.

## Implementation procedure

1. Identify the collection mutation the callback owns.
2. Keep the callback local and deterministic.
3. Define abort/halting behavior.
4. Avoid network or durable workflow side effects.
5. Test add/remove through the actual association API.

## Failure modes

- external I/O in association callbacks
- assuming callbacks run for direct bulk SQL
- callback order hidden from callers
- authorization embedded in callback mutation.

## Testing

Test successful add/remove, aborted mutation, and unaffected mutation paths.

## Review checklist

- [ ] callback owns association-local behavior
- [ ] abort semantics are explicit
- [ ] no external workflow is hidden
- [ ] tests use actual collection operations
