# Active Model Dirty Lifecycle

## Problem

Dirty tracking on plain objects has no automatic persistence lifecycle; stale change information can easily be misinterpreted.

## Use when

- adding ActiveModel::Dirty;
- implementing commit/reset/rollback behavior on transient objects.

## Do not use when

- no caller needs change tracking.

## Repository inspection

Inspect setters, mutation methods, persistence/writer workflow, reset behavior, and tests.

## Implementation procedure

1. Declare tracked attributes.
2. Mark changes at mutation points.
3. Define what apply, reset, and rollback mean.
4. Call the appropriate Dirty lifecycle methods.
5. Keep irreversible side effects outside mere assignment.
6. Test current and previous values.

## Failure modes

- Dirty state treated as persistence;
- missing change marking;
- stale previous changes;
- side effects triggered during setters.

## Testing

Test assignment, repeated assignment, apply, reset, rollback, and previous/current values.

## Review checklist

- [ ] tracked fields explicit
- [ ] mutation hooks explicit
- [ ] apply/reset semantics explicit
- [ ] side effects not hidden in assignment
- [ ] lifecycle tests exist
