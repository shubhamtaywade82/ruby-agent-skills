# Authorization Decision Boundary

## Problem
Different entry points make independent permission decisions for the same operation.

## Use when
The same protected action has controller, service, job, API, or task callers.

## Do not use when
Unrelated operations with independent policy and no shared side effect.

## Repository inspection
Inspect all callers and policy/ability classes.

## Implementation procedure
Choose one authoritative decision boundary and adapt each execution surface to it.

## Failure modes
Policy drift, contradictory decisions, bypass through alternate caller.

## Testing
Test the shared decision and representative entry points.

## Review checklist
[ ] one authoritative decision [ ] adapters explicit [ ] no duplicate policy
