# Task Namespace Contract

## Problem
Flat task names collide and make operational ownership unclear.

## Use when
Adding a custom Rake task.

## Do not use when
A one-off local command that will never be committed.

## Repository inspection
Inspect existing task namespaces and naming conventions.

## Implementation procedure
Choose a namespace based on operational responsibility and use explicit action names.

## Failure modes
Collisions, ambiguous task ownership, broken automation references.

## Testing
Assert the task name exists and invokes the intended workflow.

## Review checklist
[ ] namespace [ ] action name [ ] existing collision checked
