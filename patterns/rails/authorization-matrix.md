# Authorization Matrix

## Problem

Authorization rules are distributed across controllers, policies, queries, and UI assumptions, allowing alternate paths to disagree.

## Use when

Roles, ownership, tenant scope, delegation, or privileged administrative actions materially affect access.

## Do not use when

The resource is deliberately public and has no access-control boundary.

## Repository inspection

Inspect authentication, policy objects, resource ownership, tenant scope, controllers, jobs, exports, callbacks, and admin paths.

## Implementation procedure

1. Enumerate actors/roles.
2. Enumerate resource types.
3. Enumerate actions.
4. Add tenant/ownership constraints.
5. Identify privileged exceptions.
6. Choose one authoritative policy boundary.
7. Apply the policy to every execution path.
8. Add allow/deny tests for normal and alternate paths.

## Failure modes

- authenticated means authorized
- controller protected but job/export is not
- IDOR/BOLA through direct record lookup
- admin bypass becomes tenant bypass
- policy differs by endpoint

## Testing

Test owner, unrelated user, privileged user, cross-tenant access, background job, and export/download paths as applicable.

## Review checklist

- [ ] actor/resource/action matrix
- [ ] tenant scope explicit
- [ ] privileged exceptions explicit
- [ ] alternate paths covered
- [ ] denial tests present
