# Sensitive Serialization Contract

## Problem
Sensitive model attributes can escape through serialized payloads despite secure storage.

## Use when
Serializing authentication, credential, private metadata, or security-sensitive model fields.

## Do not use when
The field is intentionally public and documented as such.

## Repository inspection
Inspect model attributes, encryption, authentication data, logs, API schemas, and consumers.

## Implementation procedure
Create an explicit allowlist and prove sensitive fields are absent unless justified by contract.

## Failure modes
Credential leakage, authorization-only fields exposed, unintended enumeration surfaces.

## Testing
Add negative assertions for representative sensitive fields.

## Review checklist
[ ] sensitive inventory [ ] allowlist [ ] negative tests [ ] consumer review
