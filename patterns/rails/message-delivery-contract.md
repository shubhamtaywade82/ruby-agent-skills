# Message Delivery Contract

## Problem

A producer and consumer exchange asynchronous messages without an explicit contract for delivery and acknowledgement behavior.

## Use when

Adding or reviewing queues, brokers, streams, events, commands, consumers, or replay workflows.

## Do not use when

The communication is entirely synchronous and no asynchronous delivery layer exists.

## Repository inspection

Inspect broker/queue guarantees, acknowledgement semantics, visibility timeout, retry/dead-letter behavior, partition/key ordering, message identifiers, retention, and consumer persistence.

## Implementation procedure

1. State delivery mode: at-most-once, at-least-once, or effectively-once via deduplication.
2. Define message identity and correlation/causation identifiers.
3. Define acknowledgement timing.
4. Define duplicate behavior.
5. Define ordering guarantees per key/partition when relevant.
6. Define retry/dead-letter/replay behavior.
7. Define schema compatibility during rolling deployment.
8. Test crash/retry/replay paths.

## Failure modes

- assuming exactly-once execution
- acknowledging before durable state
- deduplicating only in memory
- assuming global ordering
- retry storm
- poison message loop
- destructive schema change while old messages remain

## Testing

Test duplicate delivery, consumer failure before and after side effects, retry exhaustion, replay, ordering edge cases, and old/new message compatibility.

## Review checklist

- [ ] delivery semantics explicit
- [ ] acknowledgement boundary explicit
- [ ] identity/correlation explicit
- [ ] duplicate behavior explicit
- [ ] ordering assumptions explicit
- [ ] retry/dead-letter/replay explicit
- [ ] rollout compatibility tested
