# Password Recovery Contract

## Problem

Password reset is an authentication protocol. Treating it as a simple update creates token replay, enumeration, stale-session, or delivery failures.

## Use when

Adding or changing forgot-password, reset-token, password-change, recovery mail, or recovery notifications.

## Do not use when

Changing unrelated user profile fields.

## Repository inspection

Inspect reset token model/storage, expiration, mailer/job, routes, controller, password update, session revocation, and rate limits.

## Implementation procedure

1. Define reset request behavior.
2. Make account-existence response safe.
3. Generate/store a short-lived reset credential.
4. Deliver it through the trusted channel.
5. Enforce expiry and one-time consumption.
6. Change the password through the canonical credential API.
7. Revoke affected sessions/tokens.
8. Audit the event.
9. Rate-limit abuse.
10. Test valid, expired, replayed, and invalid tokens.

## Failure modes

- token never expires
- token reusable
- raw token persisted unnecessarily
- reset request reveals account existence
- compromised sessions survive reset without an explicit decision
- token appears in logs

## Testing

Test enumeration-safe request, valid reset, expired token, replay, invalid token, and post-reset session state.

## Review checklist

- [ ] one-time token semantics
- [ ] expiration
- [ ] safe response
- [ ] revocation
- [ ] abuse controls
- [ ] secret-safe logging
