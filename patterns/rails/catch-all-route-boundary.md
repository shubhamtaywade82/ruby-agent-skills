# Catch-All Route Boundary

## Problem

Wildcard and fallback routes can absorb requests that should have been handled by specific endpoints, create security surprises, or hide routing regressions.

## Use when

- adding a wildcard segment;
- implementing an SPA fallback;
- adding a final 404 or legacy redirect route;
- reviewing broad route patterns.

## Do not use when

- ordinary resourceful routes already express the desired contract.

## Repository inspection

Inspect route order, wildcard segments, existing 404 behavior, redirect conventions, frontend fallback behavior, and negative route tests.

## Implementation procedure

1. Define the exact fallback population.
2. Put narrow routes first.
3. Exclude sensitive/system paths where needed.
4. Define redirect status/target semantics explicitly.
5. Test intended misses and protected paths.

## Failure modes

- fallback captures health/admin/API routes;
- user-controlled redirect target creates an open redirect;
- wildcard masks missing-route regressions;
- catch-all becomes an implicit authorization layer.

## Testing

Test intended fallback requests and important paths that must not fall through.

## Review checklist

- [ ] fallback population explicit
- [ ] order intentional
- [ ] redirect behavior safe
- [ ] important negative cases tested
