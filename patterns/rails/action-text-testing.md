# Action Text Testing

## Problem

Rich-text features can pass model tests while failing on sanitization, embedded resources, rendering, or API contracts.

## Use when

- adding/changing Action Text;
- reviewing rich-text security or regression behavior.

## Do not use when

- no Action Text behavior exists.

## Repository inspection

Inspect test framework, Action Text helpers/fixtures, Active Storage test service, authorization helpers, request/API tests, and query/performance tooling.

## Implementation procedure

1. Test rich-text ownership/persistence.
2. Test authorization.
3. Test malicious HTML/link sanitization.
4. Test Active Storage attachments.
5. Test SGID attachables.
6. Test rendering and plain text.
7. Test API representation.
8. Test preload/query behavior where measurable.

## Failure modes

- default-locale/default-content-only tests;
- no negative XSS tests;
- attachable authorization omitted;
- live cloud dependency;
- full HTML snapshots.

## Testing

Prefer semantic assertions, security negatives, attachment references, rendering contracts, and deterministic fixture storage.

## Review checklist

- [ ] persistence
- [ ] authorization
- [ ] sanitization
- [ ] attachment/attachable
- [ ] rendering
- [ ] API
- [ ] performance
- [ ] deterministic
