# Shared Kernel Contract

## Problem
Shared abstractions between domains become coupling sinks when their contract changes at the speed of consumers.

## Use when
Two or more contexts genuinely share a small stable concept or invariant.

## Do not use when
The abstraction is volatile, domain-specific, or owned by one context.

## Repository inspection
Inspect consumers, change history, terminology, and ownership.

## Implementation procedure
Keep the kernel small, stable, and explicitly owned; duplicate volatile concepts instead of sharing them prematurely.

## Failure modes
Kernel becomes common dumping ground, synchronized deploys, unrelated breakage.

## Testing
Test shared contract and representative consumers.

## Review checklist
[ ] small surface [ ] stable semantics [ ] owner [ ] consumer evidence
