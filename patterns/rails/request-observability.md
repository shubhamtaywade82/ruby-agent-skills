# Request Observability

## Problem
Production requests are hard to diagnose when logs, metrics, and errors cannot be correlated.

## Use when
A request path needs explicit correlation, structured logs, duration/status metrics, or error context.

## Implementation procedure
1. Inspect existing request ID/log-tag conventions.
2. Reuse Rails/request context already available.
3. Define minimal event fields.
4. Add instrumentation at meaningful boundaries.
5. Keep metric dimensions low-cardinality.
6. Filter sensitive parameters before logging.
7. Test correlation/event emission.

## Failure modes
- duplicate correlation identifiers
- raw IDs/user strings as metric labels
- full request bodies in logs
- instrumentation that mutates business behavior

## Testing
Assert structured event fields and request correlation rather than exact log formatting when possible.

## Review checklist
- request ID preserved
- logs are minimal
- metrics have bounded dimensions
- sensitive data filtered
- instrumentation is side-effect free

## Repository inspection

Inspect the repository's runtime/version, existing conventions, neighboring tests or implementation patterns, and the actual owning boundary before applying this pattern.

## Do not use when

Do not use when there is no request-level correlation, logging, metric, or diagnostic requirement.
