# Action Mailbox Processing Lifecycle

## Problem

Mailbox code often mixes routing, eligibility, domain mutation, external calls, and error handling into one unbounded process method.

## Use when

- adding a mailbox;
- refactoring mailbox callbacks;
- reviewing failed/bounced processing;
- integrating jobs or external dependencies.

## Do not use when

- the change only affects provider transport authentication.

## Repository inspection

Inspect mailbox callbacks, domain services, transaction boundaries, rescue handlers, jobs, mailers, and status/failure conventions.

## Implementation procedure

1. Put cheap prerequisites in before_processing.
2. Resolve sender/recipient/resource context.
3. Authorize the operation.
4. Perform domain changes in the owning transaction.
5. Enqueue follow-up work after the required commit boundary.
6. Classify permanent versus transient failure.
7. Use bounce/reject for business-invalid mail and failed/retryable handling for transient defects.
8. Emit lifecycle telemetry.

## Failure modes

- broad rescue marks programmer errors as success;
- external call inside a long DB transaction;
- job enqueued before required commit;
- bounce used for every failure;
- callback performs unrelated domain work.

## Testing

Cover prerequisite rejection, success, transient failure, permanent rejection, callback ordering, and post-commit job behavior.

## Review checklist

- [ ] prerequisite boundary explicit
- [ ] authorization before mutation
- [ ] transaction owner explicit
- [ ] async boundary explicit
- [ ] failure classes explicit
- [ ] framework status remains truthful
