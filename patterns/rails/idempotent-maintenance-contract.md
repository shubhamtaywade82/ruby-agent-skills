# Idempotent Maintenance Contract

## Problem
Interrupted or repeated maintenance can duplicate work or corrupt state when reruns are unsafe.

## Use when
Backfills, repair tasks, reconciliation, cleanup, and recurring maintenance.

## Do not use when
A one-time transactional change whose database constraint guarantees exact-once semantics.

## Repository inspection
Inspect selection predicate, completion marker, unique constraints, and rerun behavior.

## Implementation procedure
Make completion detectable and repeated execution converge on the intended state.

## Failure modes
Double processing, duplicated records, repeated side effects, or impossible resume state.

## Testing
Run the task twice and assert the second run causes no unintended new effects.

## Review checklist
[ ] repeatable [ ] completion detectable [ ] side effects bounded
