# Mailer Security Boundary

## Problem

Email can export sensitive data outside application authentication and authorization boundaries.

## Use when

- sending tenant/private data;
- sending password/reset/security notifications;
- attaching files;
- changing recipients or CC/BCC;
- reviewing staging/production email safety.

## Do not use when

- the message is truly public and has no private data or privileged capability.

## Repository inspection

Inspect authorization, tenant resolution, consent/preferences, data classification, token lifecycle, attachment access, mail logs, and environment delivery safeguards.

## Implementation procedure

1. Classify message data.
2. Verify recipient eligibility.
3. Verify tenant/resource scope.
4. Review URLs/capabilities and token lifetime.
5. Review attachment authorization.
6. Filter logs/errors.
7. Add negative security tests.
8. Verify staging cannot accidentally deliver externally.

## Failure modes

- cross-tenant recipients;
- sensitive values in logs;
- reusable security tokens;
- unauthorized attachments;
- staging accidentally emailing real users.

## Testing

Test authorized/unauthorized recipients, tenant separation, sensitive-field filtering, and unsafe-environment delivery safeguards.

## Review checklist

- [ ] recipient authorized
- [ ] tenant scope enforced
- [ ] tokens minimized/lifetime understood
- [ ] attachments authorized
- [ ] logs filtered
- [ ] environment safeguard
