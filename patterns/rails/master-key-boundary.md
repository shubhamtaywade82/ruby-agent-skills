# Master Key Boundary

## Problem
The credential ciphertext can be public while the decryption key must remain secret and tightly controlled.

## Use when
Changing config/master.key, environment key delivery, or require_master_key.

## Do not use when
Changing unrelated non-secret configuration.

## Repository inspection
Inspect repository ignore rules, deployment secret injection, CI variables, containers, and boot configuration.

## Implementation procedure
Keep key files out of source distribution; inject required keys through the approved deployment mechanism; fail closed when required.

## Failure modes
Leaked master keys, secrets embedded in images, permissive file access, or silent boot fallback.

## Testing
Test production-like boot with and without the required key.

## Review checklist
[ ] key absent from Git [ ] runtime delivery [ ] fail-closed behavior [ ] access reviewed
