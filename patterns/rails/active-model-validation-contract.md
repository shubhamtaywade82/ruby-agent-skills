# Active Model Validation Contract

## Problem

A transient model can incorrectly become responsible for authorization, persistence integrity, or workflow orchestration merely because it owns validation.

## Use when

- adding Active Model validations;
- changing form/input errors;
- exposing errors to Action View or APIs.

## Do not use when

- the rule is database-only integrity.

## Repository inspection

Inspect input boundary, existing validators, error translations, persisted-model constraints, and consumers.

## Implementation procedure

1. Define the acceptable object state.
2. Add model validation for that state.
3. Keep authorization separate.
4. Keep database invariants with database constraints.
5. Preserve error keys/messages as a contract.
6. Test valid, invalid, boundary, and strict-validation behavior.

## Failure modes

- validation used as authorization;
- remote API calls from validators;
- database uniqueness assumed from validation alone;
- error shape changed accidentally.

## Testing

Test valid?, errors, validation contexts, strict failures, and representative input boundaries.

## Review checklist

- [ ] state rule explicit
- [ ] authorization separate
- [ ] persistence integrity separate
- [ ] error contract preserved
- [ ] boundary tests exist
