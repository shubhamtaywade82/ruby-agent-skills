# Inbox Deduplication

## Problem

A consumer can receive the same logical message more than once because of retries, redelivery, or replay.

## Use when

A message/event can be delivered at least once and duplicate side effects are not acceptable.

## Do not use when

The downstream effect is demonstrably idempotent and no durable duplicate tracking is required.

## Repository inspection

Inspect message identity, consumer database, unique constraints, transaction scope, side effects, acknowledgement semantics, and existing idempotent job patterns.

## Implementation procedure

1. Define the message/event identity scope.
2. Bind identity to the correct producer/type/tenant namespace.
3. Reserve or insert inbox state under a database uniqueness constraint.
4. Apply the side effect and completion state in the correct transaction boundary.
5. Decide whether duplicate delivery returns prior success, no-ops, or replays safely.
6. Handle consumer crash before and after the side effect.
7. Retain enough history for the supported replay window.
8. Use idempotent-job for any subsequent Active Job execution.

## Failure modes

- process-local deduplication
- missing unique constraint
- marking processed before durable side effect
- message identity changes on retry
- inbox table grows without retention/recovery policy
- dedupe hides a poison message

## Testing

Test sequential duplicates, concurrent duplicates, crash/retry around the side effect, replay, same identity with conflicting payload, and retention behavior where applicable.

## Review checklist

- [ ] message identity is stable
- [ ] identity uniqueness is database-enforced
- [ ] side-effect boundary is explicit
- [ ] concurrent duplicate behavior is tested
- [ ] replay policy is explicit
- [ ] retention is bounded
