# Active Record Deletion Contract

## Problem

Deleting a row and destroying an Active Record object have different lifecycle and dependency semantics.

## Use when

- changing destroy/delete behavior
- changing dependent options
- adding bulk deletion
- debugging orphaned records.

## Do not use when

- no deletion semantics change.

## Repository inspection

Inspect associations, dependent options, callbacks, database cascades, audit/event behavior, storage cleanup, and authorization.

## Implementation procedure

1. Define the required business outcome.
2. Map application and database deletion behavior.
3. Identify callbacks and dependent cleanup.
4. Choose destroy/delete/bulk operation deliberately.
5. Add regression tests for dependents and side effects.

## Failure modes

- deleting without authorization
- assuming database cascade invokes model callbacks
- creating orphaned storage or audit records
- switching to delete for unmeasured performance.

## Testing

Test parent deletion, dependent behavior, authorization, cleanup, and bulk semantics.

## Review checklist

- [ ] deletion is authorized
- [ ] application and DB cascades are understood
- [ ] cleanup is explicit
- [ ] irreversible effects are tested
