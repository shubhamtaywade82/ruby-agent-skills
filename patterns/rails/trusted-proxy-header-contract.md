# Trusted Proxy Header Contract

## Problem
Forwarded host, scheme, and client IP headers are attacker-controlled when the deployment does not establish a trusted proxy.

## Use when
Proxy-aware URL generation, client-IP handling, HTTPS enforcement, or security decisions depend on forwarded headers.

## Do not use when
A request originates directly from clients without a trusted proxy contract.

## Repository inspection
Inspect ingress/load balancer topology, trusted proxy configuration, header normalization, and tests for direct versus proxied requests.

## Implementation procedure
Define trusted hops and authoritative headers, then consume only normalized values after the trust boundary.

## Failure modes
Host/IP spoofing, insecure redirects, incorrect audit identity, and rate-limit bypass.

## Testing
Test direct clients, trusted proxy requests, malformed headers, and multi-hop behavior relevant to deployment.

## Review checklist
[ ] trusted hops explicit
[ ] raw headers not trusted blindly
[ ] direct path tested
[ ] security consumer verified
