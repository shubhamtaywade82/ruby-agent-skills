# Cache Capacity Review

## Problem

Cache hit-rate optimization can hide memory, network, serialization, eviction, and hot-key costs.

## Use when

- cache size or eviction behavior is changing;
- large values or high-cardinality keys are introduced;
- hit rate looks good while latency or resource usage worsens.

## Do not use when

- cache usage is trivial and capacity is not a meaningful constraint.

## Repository inspection

Inspect cache-store limits, value size distribution, TTLs, eviction policy, key cardinality, serialization format, network latency, namespaces, and process/region topology.

## Implementation procedure

1. Estimate item count and value size.
2. Inspect TTL distribution.
3. Identify hot keys and high-cardinality namespaces.
4. Measure serialization/network overhead.
5. Determine eviction behavior.
6. Set bounded growth expectations.
7. Add operational signals.

## Failure modes

- unbounded namespace growth;
- large values causing network/serialization overhead;
- hot-key contention;
- short TTL increasing misses;
- long TTL retaining obsolete data;
- eviction causing load spikes.

## Testing

Use representative value sizes and cardinalities where practical; verify key growth and behavior under eviction/failure.

## Review checklist

- [ ] capacity model
- [ ] value size
- [ ] cardinality
- [ ] TTL
- [ ] eviction
- [ ] hot-key behavior
- [ ] operational visibility
