# Asset Dependency Boundary

## Problem

Frontend dependency changes can alter runtime, install, build, and supply-chain behavior outside the immediate feature.

## Use when
Adding/updating npm/Bun/yarn/pnpm packages or JavaScript/CSS build runtimes.

## Do not use when
The change is internal application code with no dependency graph change.

## Repository inspection
Inspect package manager, lockfile, runtime version, install scripts, registry configuration, and CI.

## Implementation procedure
Change the smallest dependency set, preserve lockfile integrity, audit install/build scripts, and verify clean installation.

## Failure modes
Transitive drift, malicious install scripts, incompatible runtime versions, and undocumented private registry assumptions.

## Testing
Run clean dependency installation and the relevant asset build.

## Review checklist
[ ] lockfile updated intentionally
[ ] runtime compatible
[ ] install scripts reviewed
[ ] CI clean install verified
