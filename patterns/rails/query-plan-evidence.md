# Query Plan Evidence

## Problem

A Rails query is believed to be slow or inefficient, but the proposed fix is based on intuition rather than database execution evidence.

## Use when

Changing a query, scope, join, predicate, select list, or index because of measured database performance.

## Do not use when

The change is purely semantic or the query is not the measured bottleneck.

## Repository inspection

Inspect the Rails/adapter/database versions, exact generated SQL, existing indexes, representative table size/cardinality, query logs, and repository database tooling.

## Implementation procedure

1. Capture the exact query shape.
2. Measure baseline latency/query count.
3. Run the database's execution-plan tool.
4. Identify scans, joins, sorts, row estimates, and expensive operations.
5. Form one concrete hypothesis.
6. Make the smallest query/index change that addresses the evidence.
7. Re-run the plan.
8. Re-measure the workload.
9. Check write/storage trade-offs when indexes changed.

## Failure modes

- adding an index without plan evidence
- optimizing a development-sized dataset
- trusting estimated rows without checking actual behavior
- fixing a SQL plan while increasing object materialization
- ignoring write amplification from indexes
- comparing plans from different workloads

## Testing

Preserve functional query tests and add/retain a performance check at the appropriate boundary. For index changes, verify the migration contract and representative query plan where infrastructure permits.

## Review checklist

- [ ] exact SQL identified
- [ ] baseline measured
- [ ] execution plan captured
- [ ] hypothesis tied to plan evidence
- [ ] new plan checked
- [ ] write/storage cost considered
- [ ] functional tests pass
