# Job Retry Policy

## Problem
Unbounded, immediate, or semantically incorrect retries can amplify incidents or repeat permanent failures.

## Use when
A job talks to unreliable infrastructure, rate-limited dependencies, or has explicit transient/permanent exception classes.

## Do not use when
The work is deterministic and failures should immediately surface without retry.

## Procedure
1. Classify exceptions as transient or permanent.
2. Use retry_on only for transient failures.
3. Choose attempts and backoff from recovery/capacity expectations.
4. Add jitter when synchronized retry bursts are possible.
5. Use discard_on only when retrying is not meaningful.
6. Report terminal failures when operational action is required.
7. Test each exception path.

## Failure modes
- retrying authorization/validation failures
- infinite rapid retries
- catching broad exceptions and retrying everything
- retrying a non-idempotent side effect without protection

## Testing
Assert retry scheduling/attempt policy and terminal discard/failure behavior.

## Review checklist
- exception taxonomy is explicit
- backoff is justified
- attempts are bounded unless unlimited is intentional
- terminal failures remain observable
