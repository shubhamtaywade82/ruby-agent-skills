# Active Model Serialization Contract

## Problem

Model-like objects are easy to serialize too broadly, exposing internal or sensitive attributes.

## Use when

- using ActiveModel::Serialization;
- exposing serializable_hash or JSON representations;
- passing Active Model state across boundaries.

## Do not use when

- serialization is not a public or durable boundary.

## Repository inspection

Inspect API serializers, job payloads, existing serialization methods, sensitive fields, and compatibility tests.

## Implementation procedure

1. Define the representation.
2. Declare explicit serialized attributes.
3. Add only intentional computed fields.
4. Exclude secrets/private fields.
5. Version or stabilize the contract when external consumers depend on it.
6. Test positive and negative serialization cases.

## Failure modes

- all attributes serialized accidentally;
- sensitive fields exposed;
- computed method leaks privileged state;
- serialization shape changes silently.

## Testing

Assert exact intended fields and absence of sensitive fields.

## Review checklist

- [ ] fields explicit
- [ ] sensitive attributes excluded
- [ ] representation ownership clear
- [ ] compatibility tested
