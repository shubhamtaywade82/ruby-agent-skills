# Engine Mount and Routing Contract

## Problem
An engine can be internally correct but incorrectly exposed by the host mount and route integration.

## Use when
Mounting or changing engine routes.

## Do not use when
An engine is not HTTP-facing.

## Repository inspection
Inspect engine routes, host routes, mount points, helper usage, constraints, and authorization boundaries.

## Implementation procedure
Define mount path, helper semantics, constraints, and host security expectations.

## Failure modes
Route collisions, unexpected exposure, broken URL generation, missing authorization.

## Testing
Test engine routes and host-mounted routes in the dummy/host app.

## Review checklist
[ ] mount explicit [ ] helpers verified [ ] exposure reviewed [ ] auth boundary
