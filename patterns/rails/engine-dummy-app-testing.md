# Engine Dummy Application Testing Contract

## Problem
Engine unit tests can miss mounting, configuration, host integration, and lifecycle failures.

## Use when
Changing engine-host integration or public engine behavior.

## Do not use when
Purely internal engine object behavior.

## Repository inspection
Inspect dummy app routes/configuration, fixtures, engine test helpers, and integration tests.

## Implementation procedure
Use a representative dummy application to exercise realistic host integration.

## Failure modes
Tests pass in isolation but fail when mounted or configured in a host.

## Testing
Test mount, routes, configuration, boot, and representative engine behavior.

## Review checklist
[ ] dummy app representative [ ] mount tested [ ] config tested [ ] boot tested
