# Turbo Drive Navigation Contract

## Problem
Turbo navigation changes page lifecycle and can expose duplicate listeners or stale client state.

## Use when
A page or layout relies on navigation events, persistent DOM, page-specific scripts, or browser history.

## Structure
Keep persistent shell state separate from page state and initialize and cleanup behavior explicitly.

## Testing
Verify visit, back/forward, redirect, and revisit behavior where material.

## Do not use when
The page does not depend on Turbo lifecycle behavior.

## Repository inspection
Inspect layouts, Turbo setup, existing lifecycle listeners, Stimulus controllers, and browser/system tests.

## Implementation procedure
Identify persistent versus page state, use documented lifecycle hooks, make initialization idempotent, and clean up page-specific resources.

## Failure modes
Duplicate listeners, stale page state, broken back navigation, and state leaking between visits.

## Testing
Test navigation, revisit, and back/forward behavior where lifecycle state matters.

## Review checklist
Persistent state is intentional, cleanup is deterministic, and browser history remains correct.
