# Active Support Callback Boundary

## Problem

Generic callbacks can make lifecycle behavior reusable, but they can also hide control flow and side effects.

## Use when

- defining custom lifecycle callbacks;
- reviewing before/around/after callback chains outside Active Record.

## Do not use when

- explicit methods are clearer;
- model-specific callbacks are already owned by Active Model/Active Record.

## Repository inspection

Inspect callback events, callers, side effects, abort semantics, ordering, and tests.

## Implementation procedure

1. Define the lifecycle event.
2. Define before/around/after semantics.
3. Make abort/failure behavior explicit.
4. Keep callbacks narrow.
5. Keep external effects out of generic callback infrastructure.
6. Test ordering and failure semantics.

## Failure modes

- callback chain becomes business workflow;
- unclear abort behavior;
- nested around callbacks obscure control flow;
- callback invokes external service inside critical path.

## Testing

Test callback order, around nesting, abort behavior, exception propagation, and successful completion.

## Review checklist

- [ ] lifecycle event explicit
- [ ] ordering explicit
- [ ] failure/abort semantics explicit
- [ ] side effects bounded
- [ ] callback tests exist
