# Validation Uniqueness Database Contract

## Problem
Validation Uniqueness Database Contract needs an explicit contract so validation does not drift between model logic, database integrity, and consumers.

## Use when
- a value or composite key must remain unique across concurrent writers.

## Do not use when
- application validation is being treated as the sole enforcement mechanism.

## Repository inspection
- uniqueness validator;
- scope/case/conditions;
- normalization;
- existing indexes/constraints;
- tenant key;
- conflict handling.

## Implementation procedure
1. Define the logical uniqueness key.
2. Align application and persisted representations.
3. Add or verify the unique index/constraint.
4. Define application behavior for the database conflict.
5. Test sequential and conflict cases.

## Failure modes
- scope mismatch;
- case/collation mismatch;
- tenant key omitted;
- race condition remains.

## Testing
- duplicate create;
- scoped/tenant uniqueness;
- case/normalization;
- database conflict.

## Review checklist
- [ ] validator is feedback
- [ ] database constraint is authoritative
- [ ] scope and normalization agree
