# N+1 Review

## Problem

A parent collection triggers one or more additional database queries per row because an association is accessed lazily inside iteration.

## Use when

Reviewing a Rails read path where records are loaded and associated records are accessed repeatedly.

## Do not use when

The association is not actually accessed per record, or when query-plan evidence shows that N+1 is not the measured bottleneck.

## Repository inspection

Inspect the Rails version, Active Record associations, generated SQL/logs, representative cardinality, existing query objects/scopes, and tests that assert query behavior.

## Implementation procedure

1. Reproduce the workload.
2. Capture query count and SQL shape.
3. Identify the lazy association access.
4. Choose among preload, eager_load, includes, joins/selects, or a different read model based on the required result shape.
5. Check row explosion and memory cost.
6. Add a focused regression test for the query contract.
7. Re-measure.

## Failure modes

- eager-loading unused associations
- row multiplication from joins
- loading huge collections into memory
- hiding the N+1 rather than removing it
- fixing one association while another remains lazy
- adding broad query helpers that obscure ownership

## Testing

Test the observable result and, where query count is part of the performance contract, assert a bounded query count using the repository's existing instrumentation/testing convention.

## Review checklist

- [ ] N+1 reproduced or evidenced
- [ ] chosen loading strategy matches query shape
- [ ] row/cardinality impact considered
- [ ] memory impact considered
- [ ] regression coverage added
- [ ] query count re-measured
- [ ] no speculative eager loading introduced
