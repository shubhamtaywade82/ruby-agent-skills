# Through Association Contract

## Problem

Through associations combine multiple relationship declarations and can hide join creation, deletion, cardinality, and domain ownership.

## Use when

- adding or changing has_many through
- changing join models
- changing assignment or collection mutation through a join.

## Do not use when

- the join is purely a query concern with no association contract.

## Repository inspection

Inspect source association, join model, target association, validations, uniqueness, foreign keys, callbacks, and authorization.

## Implementation procedure

1. Define the source, join, and target cardinalities.
2. Decide whether the join model is the domain owner of relationship state.
3. Use source/source_type/class_name explicitly when needed.
4. Test creation/removal/assignment semantics.
5. Verify that deleting join records does not accidentally imply deleting targets.

## Failure modes

- HABTM for a behavior-rich join
- assuming through deletion destroys target records
- missing uniqueness on join pairs
- ambiguous source association.

## Testing

Test join creation, replacement, removal, duplicate prevention, target preservation, and authorization.

## Review checklist

- [ ] join ownership is explicit
- [ ] cardinality is correct
- [ ] mutations are understood
- [ ] target lifecycle is separate from join lifecycle
