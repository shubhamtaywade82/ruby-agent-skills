# Architecture Fitness Check Contract

## Problem
Architecture rules decay when they exist only in documentation.

## Use when
A boundary or dependency rule can be mechanically detected.

## Do not use when
The rule depends on nuanced runtime/business judgment that cannot be reduced safely.

## Repository inspection
Inspect static structure, namespaces, dependencies, routes, public APIs, schemas, and existing validators.

## Implementation procedure
Encode stable structural rules as tests/checks while keeping higher-order review human/agent-driven.

## Failure modes
Brittle checker, false positives, gaming, architecture reduced to folder names.

## Testing
Run the check against known-valid and known-invalid fixtures when possible.

## Review checklist
[ ] rule stable [ ] executable [ ] false-positive path [ ] not gameable
