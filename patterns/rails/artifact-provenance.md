# Artifact Provenance

## Problem
Rebuilding per environment makes it difficult to prove what was actually tested and deployed.

## Use when
- designing build/promotion pipelines;
- reviewing release evidence;
- debugging environment-specific release drift.

## Do not use when
- the repository deliberately uses a different immutable artifact model and already proves identity another way.

## Repository inspection
Inspect CI build jobs, image/package identifiers, lockfiles, registries, tags/digests, deployment manifests, and release metadata.

## Implementation procedure
1. Capture source revision. 2. Capture dependency lock/build inputs. 3. Produce an immutable artifact identity. 4. Promote the same artifact. 5. Record target environment and deployment result. 6. Make provenance queryable.

## Failure modes
- per-environment rebuilds;
- mutable image tags without digest tracking;
- missing source-to-artifact link;
- secrets embedded in provenance.

## Testing
Verify that a promoted artifact retains its source identity and that release records reference the same immutable artifact.

## Review checklist
- [ ] source revision; - [ ] dependency identity; - [ ] immutable artifact; - [ ] promotion identity; - [ ] no secrets.
