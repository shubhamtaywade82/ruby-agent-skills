# Mounted Endpoint Boundary

## Problem

A mounted endpoint introduces a second dispatch surface with its own ownership, helpers, middleware, and failure behavior.

## Use when

- mounting Rack application endpoints;
- mounting a Rails engine;
- reviewing route precedence around a mount.

## Do not use when

- routing only to a normal Rails controller action.

## Repository inspection

Inspect mount path, component ownership, helper/proxy behavior, authentication/authorization, middleware, and route-table order.

## Implementation procedure

1. Identify the mounted component owner and trust boundary.
2. Choose the mount path deliberately.
3. Verify helper/proxy behavior.
4. Preserve authentication and authorization boundaries.
5. Inspect route precedence around the mount.
6. Add dispatch and failure tests where appropriate.

## Failure modes

- mounted route shadows application routes;
- auth boundary assumed to transfer automatically;
- helper exposes unintended internals;
- failure behavior untested.

## Testing

Verify mounted requests, helper/proxy behavior, route precedence, and failure behavior where supported.

## Review checklist

- [ ] owner explicit
- [ ] mount path intentional
- [ ] route order reviewed
- [ ] auth boundary explicit
- [ ] helper/proxy behavior tested
