# Authorization Audit Contract

## Problem
Security decisions are not explainable or observable, or logs expose sensitive data.

## Structure
Record actor, tenant, action, resource type/id, decision, bounded reason code, and correlation identifier as appropriate.

## Failure modes
Passwords/tokens in logs, arbitrary policy internals, and unbounded resource data.

## Testing
Assert audit events exist for security-critical decisions and contain no credential material.

## Use when

Use this pattern when the named security boundary is part of the requested change.

## Do not use when

Do not introduce this pattern when a simpler repository-consistent boundary already proves the required contract.

## Repository inspection

Inspect the existing authorization mechanism, entry points, resource ownership, tenant scope, tests, and versioned dependencies.

## Implementation procedure

Define the authoritative boundary, adapt to repository conventions, preserve denial semantics, and add focused regression coverage.

## Review checklist

[ ] authoritative mechanism preserved
[ ] bypass paths reviewed
[ ] tenant/resource scope explicit
[ ] rejection behavior tested
