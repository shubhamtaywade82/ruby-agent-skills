# Action View Output Safety

## Problem

Presentation code can accidentally turn untrusted strings into executable HTML.

## Use when

- using raw, html_safe, safe_join, or sanitize;
- rendering user-controlled HTML;
- reviewing XSS regressions;
- changing sanitizer configuration.

## Do not use when

- output is plain text and standard escaping remains untouched.

## Repository inspection

Inspect current escaping behavior, sanitizer configuration, trusted content sources, user-generated HTML, Action Text usage, and security tests.

## Implementation procedure

1. Identify the data source and trust level.
2. Keep default escaping enabled for untrusted strings.
3. Use sanitize when intentionally accepting constrained HTML.
4. Minimize custom sanitizer allowlists.
5. Isolate trusted markup construction from untrusted values.
6. Add malicious-markup and unsafe-URL regression tests.
7. Review caches and translations when rendered output is shared.

## Failure modes

- raw user input;
- broad sanitizer allowlists;
- trusting MIME/content labels;
- marking translated strings HTML-safe without review;
- cache leakage of sanitized private content.

## Testing

Include representative tags, event handlers, unsafe schemes such as javascript:, and mixed trusted/untrusted output.

## Review checklist

- [ ] trust level explicit
- [ ] escaping preserved
- [ ] sanitizer policy bounded
- [ ] unsafe URLs covered
- [ ] cache/privacy impact reviewed
