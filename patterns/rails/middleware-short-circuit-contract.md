# Middleware Short Circuit Contract

## Problem
Early responses can accidentally bypass required authentication, telemetry, cleanup, or downstream work.

## Use when
Rate limiting, trusted-host rejection, infrastructure-owned static responses, or other explicitly owned early exits are required.

## Do not use when
A business decision or resource authorization is being moved out of its owning layer.

## Repository inspection
Inspect security/authentication ownership, required telemetry, headers, status conventions, and response lifecycle.

## Implementation procedure
Define the status, headers, body, downstream skip semantics, and observability for the short-circuit path.

## Failure modes
False-success responses, bypassed controls, missing headers, and inconsistent telemetry.

## Testing
Test both short-circuit and delegated paths plus required headers and body behavior.

## Review checklist
[ ] owner explicit
[ ] downstream skip intentional
[ ] response complete
[ ] telemetry/security preserved
