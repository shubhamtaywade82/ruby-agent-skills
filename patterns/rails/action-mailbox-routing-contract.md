# Action Mailbox Routing Contract

## Problem

Mailbox routing is easy to make ambiguous when broad patterns, aliases, and catch-all rules overlap.

## Use when

- adding a mailbox route;
- changing recipient aliases;
- introducing catch-all/backstop routing;
- reviewing misrouted inbound mail.

## Do not use when

- routing is not changing and the task only changes mailbox internals.

## Repository inspection

Inspect ApplicationMailbox, route order, address normalization, existing mailbox classes, tenant/alias lookup, and tests for overlapping recipients.

## Implementation procedure

1. Enumerate supported recipient forms.
2. Place specific routes before general routes.
3. Define normalization rules.
4. Define one explicit unmatched/backstop policy.
5. Keep routing separate from resource authorization.
6. Test positive, collision, and unmatched cases.
7. Add route-level diagnostics where the repository already has tracing.

## Failure modes

- broad route shadows a specific route;
- case/normalization mismatch;
- tenant authorization inferred from recipient pattern;
- silent unmatched-message loss;
- alias change breaks old/new compatibility.

## Testing

Test route precedence, aliases, normalization, unmatched recipients, and cross-tenant recipient attempts.

## Review checklist

- [ ] route order explicit
- [ ] normalization explicit
- [ ] catch-all behavior intentional
- [ ] routing distinct from authorization
- [ ] collisions tested
- [ ] unmatched behavior tested
