# Action View Render Performance

## Problem

Slow views can result from rendering work, data access triggered by rendering, cache misses, compilation, allocation pressure, or oversized output.

## Use when

- diagnosing slow pages;
- optimizing large partial collections;
- reviewing view-driven N+1s;
- changing collection rendering or fragment caching for performance.

## Do not use when

- there is no measured rendering or response bottleneck.

## Repository inspection

Inspect request timings, view instrumentation, query traces, template structure, partial counts, cache behavior, and preload/query conventions.

## Implementation procedure

1. Establish baseline latency, query, and allocation evidence.
2. Separate controller/data-preparation cost from view-render cost.
3. Identify repeated partial or helper work.
4. Choose collection/object rendering or preload changes that own the bottleneck.
5. Add cache only with explicit correctness identity.
6. Measure again.
7. Record workload-specific tradeoffs.

## Failure modes

- optimizing without measurement;
- hiding N+1 behind caching;
- globally preloading unrelated data;
- increasing memory or compilation cost for marginal gain;
- caching authorization-sensitive output too broadly.

## Testing

Use deterministic request/render tests and stable performance measurements where repository thresholds exist.

## Review checklist

- [ ] baseline captured
- [ ] bottleneck isolated
- [ ] query/render distinction explicit
- [ ] cache correctness reviewed
- [ ] post-change evidence captured
