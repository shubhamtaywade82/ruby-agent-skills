# Route Helper Contract

## Problem

Route declarations generate helpers that become application-wide contracts; changing helper names or object-to-route semantics can break callers without changing controller code.

## Use when

- changing as, param, path, or nesting;
- changing polymorphic routing;
- introducing direct/resolve mappings;
- debugging generated URLs.

## Do not use when

- no path/URL generation is affected.

## Repository inspection

Search helper callers, to_param, model naming, route names, mailer/job/serializer uses, and route-generation tests.

## Implementation procedure

1. Record current helper names and signatures.
2. Identify caller categories.
3. Change declarations intentionally.
4. Verify generated path and URL helpers.
5. Test persisted/new-record object routing where applicable.
6. Migrate callers in the same coherent change when compatibility is intentionally broken.

## Failure modes

- renamed helper with stale callers;
- wrong parent/child object order;
- unstable to_param behavior;
- singular mapping missing;
- absolute URL generated with an unexpected host.

## Testing

Test helper names/signatures, polymorphic paths, and representative absolute URLs when those are public contracts.

## Review checklist

- [ ] helper contract inventoried
- [ ] to_param/model naming inspected
- [ ] persisted/new-record behavior covered
- [ ] path vs URL use intentional
