# Active Record Strict Loading

## Problem

Association lazy loading can hide N+1 queries until production or a large test suite exposes them.

## Use when

- reviewing N+1 behavior
- adding strict_loading
- hardening a known rendering/query boundary.

## Do not use when

- association access is intentionally lazy and the workload is proven bounded.

## Repository inspection

Inspect query consumers, association access, test helpers, and existing eager-loading conventions.

## Implementation procedure

1. Identify the query path that must not issue lazy loads.
2. Choose preloading or strict_loading deliberately.
3. Keep the object graph narrow.
4. Add tests that fail on prohibited lazy access where practical.
5. Measure the resulting query count/cost.

## Failure modes

- enabling strict loading globally without migration strategy
- disabling strict loading to silence regressions
- preloading unrelated graphs.

## Testing

Exercise the consumer path and assert the intended preload/strict-loading behavior.

## Review checklist

- [ ] target path is known
- [ ] preload graph is narrow
- [ ] strict-loading failure is actionable
- [ ] query evidence exists
