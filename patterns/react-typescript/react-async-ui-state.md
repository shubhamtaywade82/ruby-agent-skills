# React Async Ui State

## Problem
Remote or deferred work produces multiple UI states that have different actions or messaging.

## Use when
A simple synchronous component has no asynchronous lifecycle.

## Do not use when
Do not activate simply when A simple synchronous component has no asynchronous lifecycle. 

## Repository inspection
Inspect resource lifecycle, retry controls, and accessibility announcements.

## Implementation procedure
Define explicit state transitions and preserve prior useful data during refresh when appropriate.

## Failure modes
One isLoading boolean, hidden errors, and empty state confused with failure.

## Testing
Test each state and transitions between them.

## Review checklist
Can the UI explain both no data and failed data retrieval?
