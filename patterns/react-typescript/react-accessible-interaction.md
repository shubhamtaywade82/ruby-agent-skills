# React Accessible Interaction

## Problem
Creating buttons, dialogs, menus, forms, tabs, or custom interactions.

## Use when
A platform-native semantic element already provides the needed contract.

## Do not use when
Do not activate simply because the UI contains JavaScript or because an abstraction is available.

## Repository inspection
Inspect existing design-system primitives and keyboard behavior.

## Implementation procedure
Use semantic elements first, define labels or roles only when necessary, and preserve keyboard support.

## Failure modes
Clickable divs, placeholder-only labels, inaccessible custom widgets, and visual-only state.

## Testing
Test role/name queries, keyboard interaction, focus, and announced state.

## Review checklist
Can a keyboard and assistive technology user discover and operate it?
