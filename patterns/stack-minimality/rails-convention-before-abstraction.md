# Rails Convention Before Abstraction

## Problem
A Rails feature often needs only an existing controller, model, route, scope, serializer, or application service.

## Use when
Adding Rails behavior or deciding whether a new service or wrapper is necessary.

## Do not use when
A real boundary has independent ownership, external integration isolation, multiple implementations, or a different lifecycle.

## Repository inspection
Inspect the relevant application boundary, existing implementations, callers, dependencies, and runtime constraints before introducing a new layer.

## Implementation procedure
Search neighboring Rails code and callers. Start at the existing boundary that owns the behavior; add a new abstraction only when it creates real responsibility or change isolation.

## Failure modes
Service-per-action proliferation, wrapper controllers, generic BaseService, and for-later extension points.

## Testing
Cover behavior at the owning Rails boundary.

## Review checklist
[ ] repository evidence checked [ ] smallest valid boundary chosen [ ] required guarantees preserved
