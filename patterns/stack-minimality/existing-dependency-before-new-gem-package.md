# Existing Dependency Before New Gem Or Package

## Problem
Every dependency adds supply-chain, upgrade, build, license, and failure surface.

## Use when
Considering a new gem, Rails plugin, npm package, or utility library.

## Do not use when
The existing stack lacks the capability or the new dependency materially improves a required boundary.

## Repository inspection
Inspect the relevant application boundary, existing implementations, callers, dependencies, and runtime constraints before introducing a new layer.

## Implementation procedure
Inspect manifests and lockfiles, transitive dependencies, runtime support, and existing utilities before adding a dependency.

## Failure modes
Duplicate libraries, overlapping utilities, and lockfile churn for trivial features.

## Testing
Run dependency resolution and relevant tests/build checks after dependency changes.

## Review checklist
[ ] repository evidence checked [ ] smallest valid boundary chosen [ ] required guarantees preserved
