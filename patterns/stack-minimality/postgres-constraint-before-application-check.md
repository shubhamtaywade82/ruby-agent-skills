# PostgreSQL Constraint Before Application Check

## Problem
Application validation alone can be bypassed by races, other writers, or direct SQL.

## Use when
Designing uniqueness, referential integrity, allowed-state, or other durable invariants.

## Do not use when
The rule is intentionally advisory or cannot be represented safely in the database.

## Repository inspection
Inspect the relevant application boundary, existing implementations, callers, dependencies, and runtime constraints before introducing a new layer.

## Implementation procedure
Inspect schema, migrations, constraints, write paths, and deployment order. Keep useful user-facing validation while making PostgreSQL enforce the durable invariant.

## Failure modes
Validation-only uniqueness and foreign-key conventions without actual constraints.

## Testing
Test application errors and database enforcement when database enforcement is part of the contract.

## Review checklist
[ ] repository evidence checked [ ] smallest valid boundary chosen [ ] required guarantees preserved
