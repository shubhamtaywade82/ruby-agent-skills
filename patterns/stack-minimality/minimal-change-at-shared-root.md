# Minimal Change At Shared Root

## Problem
A small diff is still wrong when it patches one symptom while siblings share the same broken owner.

## Use when
Bug fixes, validation gaps, authorization failures, and shared transformations.

## Do not use when
Callers intentionally have different contracts or a shared owner cannot enforce the invariant safely.

## Repository inspection
Inspect the relevant application boundary, existing implementations, callers, dependencies, and runtime constraints before introducing a new layer.

## Implementation procedure
Search all callers and tests. Fix at the narrowest common owner when contracts are shared.

## Failure modes
Patch-per-caller and inconsistent duplicated guards.

## Testing
Add a regression test at the shared boundary and preserve representative caller coverage.

## Review checklist
[ ] repository evidence checked [ ] smallest valid boundary chosen [ ] required guarantees preserved
