# Active Record Before Repository

## Problem
A pass-through repository around Active Record adds indirection without changing ownership.

## Use when
Evaluating repositories or extracting persistence code.

## Do not use when
Persistence is genuinely multi-source, independently owned, or protected by a stable persistence contract.

## Repository inspection
Inspect the relevant application boundary, existing implementations, callers, dependencies, and runtime constraints before introducing a new layer.

## Implementation procedure
Inspect models, scopes, query objects, adapters, and all callers. Keep ordinary reads and writes in Active Record; extract only a real persistence boundary.

## Failure modes
Pass-through repositories, duplicated Active Record APIs, mock-heavy persistence tests.

## Testing
Prefer integration coverage against the real test database for persistence semantics.

## Review checklist
[ ] repository evidence checked [ ] smallest valid boundary chosen [ ] required guarantees preserved
