# Performance Investigation

## Problem

A concrete workload is slower, more memory-intensive, more allocation-heavy, or lower-throughput than required.

## Use when

Use after a performance symptom or explicit measurable target exists.

## Do not use when

Do not use as justification for speculative refactoring or generic micro-optimization.

## Implementation procedure

1. Define workload and target.
2. Establish a reproducible baseline.
3. Measure the relevant dimension.
4. Profile or instrument the dominant path.
5. Identify the application-owned bottleneck.
6. Form one optimization hypothesis.
7. Change the smallest relevant surface.
8. Run functional tests.
9. Re-measure.
10. Compare relevant dimensions.
11. Keep only evidence-backed improvements.

## Testing

Use functional regression tests plus a stable performance contract when the repository has one.

## Review checklist

- baseline exists
- workload is representative
- bottleneck is measured
- optimization has a hypothesis
- behavior remains correct
- result is re-measured
- trade-offs documented

## Repository inspection

Inspect runtime/version, repository conventions, the owning boundary, neighboring implementations, and applicable tests before applying the pattern.
