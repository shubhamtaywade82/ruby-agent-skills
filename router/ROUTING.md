# Skill Routing

This file defines how an agent should select and compose skills.

## Global policy

1. Inspect the repository before implementing.
2. Resolve the Ruby/Rails version before using version-sensitive APIs.
3. Select the smallest set of skills that covers the task.
4. Add `ruby-clean-code` for non-trivial implementation/review work.
5. Add `ruby-tdd-refactoring` for behavior changes, bugs or refactors.
6. Prefer repository evidence over generic assumptions.
7. Never claim verification that was not actually run.

## Composition patterns

### Endpoint + persistence

```text
rails-routing
  + rails-controllers
  + rails-activerecord
  + rails-validations (when invariants change)
  + rails-testing
  + ruby-clean-code
```

### Bug fix

```text
ruby-debugging
  + relevant implementation skill
  + ruby-tdd-refactoring
```

### Cross-cutting refactor

```text
ruby-clean-code
  + affected implementation skill(s)
  + ruby-tdd-refactoring
```

## Conflict resolution

When skills appear to disagree:

1. explicit user requirement wins
2. existing observable behavior and tests come next
3. project conventions next
4. source-backed skill guidance next
5. generic preferences last

When evidence is insufficient, inspect more of the repository instead of guessing.

## Agent execution loop

```text
classify task
  -> resolve version
  -> inspect repository
  -> select skills
  -> state intended change
  -> implement smallest coherent patch
  -> run focused verification
  -> run regression checks
  -> inspect diff
  -> report changed/verified/not-verified
```

## Pattern selection

Patterns are selected **after** skills classify the task.

Use this sequence:

```text
classify task
  -> select skill(s)
  -> inspect repository
  -> check whether an existing local pattern already solves the shape
  -> apply the smallest suitable pattern
  -> adapt names/structure to repository conventions
  -> verify behavior
```

Patterns are optional implementation shapes, not architecture mandates.

### Pattern composition examples

#### Service workflow

```text
ruby-oop
  + ruby-method-design
  + ruby-gems-io-services (when external boundaries exist)
  + pattern:service-object
  + ruby-tdd-refactoring
```

#### Rails endpoint

```text
rails-routing
  + rails-controllers
  + rails-authentication (when protected)
  + rails-activerecord
  + pattern:request-flow
  + rails-testing
```

#### Complex query

```text
rails-activerecord
  + rails-associations
  + pattern:query-object
  + rails-testing
```

#### Bug fix

```text
ruby-debugging
  + relevant implementation skill
  + pattern:regression-test
  + ruby-tdd-refactoring
```

Do not use a pattern simply because it exists. If a direct implementation is clearer and fits the repository, prefer the direct implementation.
